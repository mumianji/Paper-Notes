This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Use of the BQP model and Schrodinger-Poisson model on same structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calculation of very low frequency C-V curves using QSCV  
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calibration process
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example illustrates calibration of the Bohm Quantum Potential model against
the Schrodinger-Poisson model for an N-MOS capacitor being biased into
inversion. Because the calibration takes place under conditions of negligible
current flow, the CARRIERS=0 option may be specified on the METHOD statement.
The N-MOS has a nominal gate oxide thickness of 20 A. The quantity which was
chosen to compare the results of the two models was the quasistatic
capacitance. The voltage range was 0V to 1V which includes the depletion
to inversion transition region.

The first section calculates the Quasi-static C-V curves using the Schrodinger
Poisson model.  Note the NUM.DIRECT = 3 specification on the MODELS statement.
This ensures that the anisotropic conduction band structure of Silicon is
accounted for.  Note also that NEW.EIG is also specified on the MODELS statement, this
causes a more efficient method to be used to solve the Schrodinger-Poisson
equation. QSCV is specified on the solve statement and a fine voltage increment
is used in order to give accurate calculation of the Quasi-static Capacitance
as a function of voltage.
The next three sections calculate the C-V curves over the same voltage range
and with the same voltage increment as for the S-P model.  Three different
sets of BQP parameters are used,  the last set gives C-V curves with very good
agreement with the S-P results.  It is possible that a different set will
give even better results, but the ones shown give the same threshold voltage
as for S-P and excellent agreement going into inversion.  It may take many
attempts to obtain close calibration.
