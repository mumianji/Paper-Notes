This example demonstrates the behaviour of a Pseudomorphic HEMT structure
using the quantum model.  The device is a standard AlGaAs / GaAs / InGaAs
PHEMT with a delta doped layer.
</p>
<p>
The structure is created within the Atlas syntax.  For more information
on HEMT simulation see the HEMT Examples Section.

<p>
Before any external biases are applied,
<b> qfactor </b> is ramped from zero to unity -
this allows the inclusion of the quantum moments function to be introduced
gradually into the equation set. A value of one represents a unity pre-multiplier
on the quantum moments function.
</p>
<p>
With the Quantum model, the electron concentration will typically be quite
different to classical prediction. This presents some difficulty for the
program in terms of the initial estimate to the electron concentration. In
classical simulations a very good initial estimate to the carrier concentration
can be derived from the doping profile. However, with Quantum this is not
always the case. Thus the quantum moments effect can be turned on gradually
using the parameter
<b> qfactor</b> .
<b> qfactor </b> might need to be ramped from very small values to unity to obtain
convergence for difficult problems.
