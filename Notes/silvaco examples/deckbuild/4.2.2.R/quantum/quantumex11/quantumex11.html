This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Example of a QTREGION statement applied to a non-linear junction profile.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Example of BBT.FORWARD and BBT.REVERSE parameters.
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In this example the QTREGION statement is used to set up a mesh suitable
for tunneling calculations. The device has two junctions, one which is
a straight line and the other which is curved. Multiple QTREGION statements
are used to create two QTREGIONs. The contour of the junction is approximately
followed and the SNRM.BEG and SNRM.END parameters are used to match the
QTREGION meshspacing with the device mesh spacing in the direction
perpendicular to the tunneling direction
is approximately normal to the junction.  An example of F.RESOLUTION is given
in the QTREGION for the linear junction.  This takes the relative mesh
spacing in the tunneling direction from a data file.
</p>
<p>
The curved junction is forward biased,  the optional BBT.FORWARD parameter
is used.  The linear junction is then reverse biased,  the BBT.FORWARD
parameter is cleared and the optional BBT.REVERSE parameter is set.  These
two parameters determine where the tunnel current is injected into the device.
BBT.FORWARD injects at the edges of the QTREGIONS, and BBT.REVERSE averages
over the junction itself.   These schemes can be more stable than the default
option,  which injects the current at the position it actually occurs in the
model.
</p>
<p>
From the LOG files we see that there is a forward bias tunneling current,
and from the Structure files we see exactly where the current is injected.
