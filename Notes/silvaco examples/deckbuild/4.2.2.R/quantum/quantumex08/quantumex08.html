This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Application of the BQP model coupled with energy balance to
a complex 3D device.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Application of BQP in case of 2D quantisation.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Effect of quantum confinement on carrier density in FINFET.
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The example illustrates the modelling of a FINFET device using BQP and Energy balance in 3D.
The quantisation inside the channel is almost 2-dimensional and since we
do not have a principal direction of quantisation we cannot be sure that
the model is calibrated until we do a calibration against a 2D
Schrodinger-Poisson model. This is not currently available in Atlas but
a calibration performed for SILVACO by the authors of the BQP model suggests
using isotropic effective masses in Silicon of 0.7 m0 with BQP.NALPHA = 0.3
and BQP.NGAMMA = 1.4.
</p>
<p>
The 3D device structure is created in DevEdit 3D and the required
models are set.  After the SOLVE.INIT statement, the solution for
a gate voltage of 0.2 Volts is obtained using the NOCURRENT initial
guess parameter.  A drain bias is applied and then the gate voltage is
ramped to turn the device on. The drain current is plotted in TonyPlot
and the device structure in TonyPlot3D. The cutplane facility of
TonyPlot3D can be used to look at the electron density and quantum
potential in the channel, which illustrate the reduced electron density
at the Si/Oxide interface.
