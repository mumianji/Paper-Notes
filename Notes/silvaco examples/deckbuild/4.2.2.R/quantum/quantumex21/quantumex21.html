In this example, we simulate intersubband GaAs/AlGaAs n-type multiple quantum
well infrared photodetector (QWIP). We optimized the material and geometrical
aspects of the QWIP to tune the wavelength of its peak responsivity, and to
eliminate all but one bound state per well.
</p>
<p>
At a voltage bias commonly found in experimental conditions for these systems,
we calculate the optical gain, and estimate the radiative capture rate of the
device. We confirm the radiative capture to be much slower than the known
phonon-driven capture for such detectors.
</p>
<p>
Intersubband n-type QWIP detectors only operate at oblique incidence angles.
We simulate the response of the detector for angles ranging from 0 to 80 degrees
with respect to the normal, and close to the wavelength of peak response.
The results take into account the coherent multiple reflections of radiation
inside the active region thanks to the Transfer Matrix Method used.
</p>
<p>
We simulate the spectral response of the detector, obtaining the absorption
and the generated photocurrent for a beam at 30 degrees with respect to the
normal. The physical structure and material properties of the device allow
only 1 bound state to exist. We set WELL.CNBS=2 in order to allow Atlas to
search for up to two states, and we confirm in the output that only 1 state
exists. This is why the bound-bound transition contribution to spontaneous
emission is zero. A non-zero contribution would indicate the existence of
multiple bound states, and therefore, degraded device performance.
