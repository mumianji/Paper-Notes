This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Use of the BQP model.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calculation of very low frequency C-V curves using QSCV  
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Effects of quantum mechanics on C-V characteristics of NMOS.
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In this example we illustrate the effects of quantum mechanics on the
quasi-static (i.e. very low frequency) capacitance of an N-MOS capacitor
as the gate bias varies, taking the device from being in accumulation
through to strong inversion.  The main features are the shift in threshold
voltage, equality of the capacitances near flat band and in depletion, and
the different asymptotic capacitance as the gate voltage becomes large,
both +ve and -ve.
</p>
<p>
The first part invokes the BQP model for both electrons and holes. This
is because quantum effects for both electrons and holes are important on
the same bias sweep.  There is negligible current flow in this device and
so CARRIERS=0 mode can be used,  which is sufficiently robust that the
model can be solved with the gate bias at -3.0 V directly.  A structure file
is saved at this point as an example of the device in accumulation. By
specifying P.Quantum on the output statement the BQP is written to the
structure file. The gate bias is then ramped all the way up to 3.0V with
QSCV specified on the solve statement in order to calculate and save the
quasistatic C-V curves. After the final voltage,  another structure file
is output as an example of inversion.  The quantum effects are only apparent
near the Si/SiO2 interface.
</p>
<p>
The second part does the semi-classical calculation over the same bias
range.
</p>
<p>
Remarks :  The BQP calculation is a self-consistent one and can take much
longer to run than the equivalent semi-classical one.
