This example demonstrates the CV characteristics of a N-type substrate
MOS capacitor with a nominal 30A gate oxide. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Calculation of CV curves using AC Analysis 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Use of the Quantum moments quantum model
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Difference between classical and quantum gate thickness
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Classical and Quantized electron density
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
A simple 1D MOS capacitor is created in this example with a 30A gate
oxide thickness.  An AC analysis is performed on the device firstly
with the
<b> classical </b> simulation and the with the
<b> quantum </b> model swtiched on.
</p>
<p>
The quantum model is activated by using the
<b> quantum </b> switch in the models statement for electrons.  Note that this activates
a quantum moments model which uses a quantum temperature calculation.
This quantum temperature can be viewed in the structure files.  Also,
the cutline created in TonyPlot can be used to examine the classical
and quantum electron concentration differences in the structure.
</p>
<p>
In accumulation, the channel carrier concentration is changed by the
addition of quantum mechanics. The peak is not so high and the electrons
spread more deeply into the substrate. The difference in gate
capacitance is noticable on the CV plot. Since gate oxide thickness is
often measured using CV techniques, this leads to erroneous results if
QM effects are not accounted for.
<b> extract </b> statements are used to show the calculated Tox from the classical and QM CV curves.
