This example demonstrates the capability of a TCAD simulation for non-local band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) at low to ultra-low voltages.
</p>
<p>
This example is related to the IEEE T-ED publication:
T. A. Jokinen and S. McNamara, &quot;Band-to-Band Tunneling Diode for Ultralow-Voltage Applications,&quot; IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, vol. 64, no. 6, pp. 2702-2706, June 2017,
and to the Silvaco Simulation Standard 2017 article &quot;TCAD Simulations of TFET and Tunneling Diode&quot;.
</p>
<p>
This gives an example of using the
<b> BBT.NONLOCAL </b> and
<b> QTREGION</b> model to study forward and reverse tunneling current in a degernerately-doped Silicon diode at room temperature (300K), and lowering the doping concentation so that the voltage hump (negative differential resistance) in forward bias is eliminated.
</p>
<p>
The deck uses the
<b> LOOP </b> statement to loop commands in
<b> DeckBuild. </b> </p>
<p>
The
<b> LOOP </b> is used to create three similar BTBT diodes with the only difference being the doping concentrations on each side of the junction. The BTBT diodes are designed with a fine mesh.  For tunneling to occur in the simulation, the junction is overlayed with a quantum region. This quantum region is defined by the statement:
<b> QTREGION</b> . This creates quadrilateral that can be connected together to form a non-planar tunneling junction.
</p>
<p>
The model
<b> BBT.NONLOCAL  </b> is specified on the MODELS statement to use the non-local tunneling model.
</p>
<p>
The simulation should be done using 80-bit precision, using the option:
</p>
<b>   simflags=&quot;-80&quot;</b> <p>
The structure file of each device in equilibrium is saved, and can be viewed in
<b> Tonyplot</b> . You can view the band diagrams and other information about the device.
