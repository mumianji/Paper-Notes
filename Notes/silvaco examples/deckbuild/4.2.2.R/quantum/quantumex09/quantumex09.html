<ul>
  <li>
 Application of the BQP model to III-V materials.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Example of setting BQP parameters on a material by material basis.

  <li>
 Rough calibration of BQP by comparing with S-P charge density.

</ul>
<p>
In this deck, a pHEMT structure is solved at equilibrium for the Schrodinger
-Poisson model and BQP model.  The BQP parameters are set on a material by
material basis, and the ones that are chosen represent a reasonable fit of the electron
density profile. The electron density profile in the channel is matched by
varying the BQP parameters. By observing the change of the key features of
the profile as the BQP parameters are varied, one can arrive at values which
give close agreement.  This is a time consuming activity.
By comparing Q-V or C-V curves one can verify that the chosen parameters are
good enough or refine the calibration further. In this case, fairly good
agreement was found with the C-V curves from a Schrodinger-Poisson model,
and so these parameters are used in the next example.
