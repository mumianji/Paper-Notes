This gives an example of using the
<b> BBT.NONLOCAL</b> model to study the forward tunneling current in a degenerately-doped
Germanium diode at 4.2K.
</p>
<p>
The deck uses the
<b> dbinternal</b> interface to consider 6 values of doping and to obtain the results in a
format suitable for use with TonyPlot.  The auxiliary file quantumex17_aux.in
is run for the 6 values of doping specified in quantumex17.in.
</p>
<p>
The auxiliary file sets up a simple p-n diode in Germanium, with a fine
mesh being specified near the actual junction.  Both the donor and acceptor
concentration are set to be the same value, as specified by the $doping
parameter supplied by the main deck.  The actual tunneling junction is set
up by the
<b> QTREGION </b> statement.  Its limits in the y-direction (-0.2 microns to 0.2 microns)
are sufficient to ensure that the tunneling slices start and end outside
the depletion region under the biasing conditions considered.
</p>
<p>
There are 6 tunneling slices which are parallel and regularly spaced,
with 151 points each on which to do the tunnel current calculation.
</p>
<p>
The parameters on the MATERIAL statement
</p>
<b> me.tunnel and  mh.tunnel</b> <p>
have the major influence on the tunneling current and can be used as
fitting parameters. ni.min is specified to avoid underflow at these
low temperatures.
</p>
<p>
The model
<b> BBT.NONLOCAL </b> is specified on the MODELS statement, along with
<b> BBT.NLDERIVS</b> which includes fully non-local coupling into the jacobian matrix.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to save out a structure point at a given value of bias, you
can see the internal quantum tunnel current as a generation rate. This
is optional.
</p>
<p>
The bias is ramped up to 0.15 V of forward bias and the I-V curves saved
in logfiles.  The
<b> extract</b> statement is used to find the peak value of the current, and the value
of bias at which it occurs.  The I-V curves are plotted.
</p>
<p>
The other plots are of the logarithm of the peak current versus the reciprocal
of the square root of the doping level.  This curve is approximately a
straight line as is observed experimentally.  Also shown is the bias at which
the tunnel current is a maximum.  This increases with the doping level,
reflecting the more favourable band lineup for tunneling under more
degenerate doping.
