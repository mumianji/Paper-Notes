This example demonstrates the spectral simulation of an organic color sensor
The device consists of three vertically stacked organic photodetectors which
are individually sensitive to blue, green and red light from top to bottom [1].
</p>
<p>
In the first part of the example, we create successively the blue, green and
red-sensitive detectors which are separated by thick glass substrates. ITO
electrodes of each detector are then created and assigned the same workfunction.
</p>
<p>
Organic materials are defined in the second part of the input deck. The dispersive
refractive index is given in an index file where the absorption coefficients of
primary absorptive materials are taken from Ref.[1]. Other material parameters
are taken from other literatures or estimated from typical values.
</p>
<p>
Similar to organic solar cells, singlet exciton rate equation and exciton
dissociation model are enabled by setting the
<b> SINGLET</b> and
<b>  S.DISSOC</b> parameters of the
<b>  MODEL</b> statement, respectively. Poole Frenkel
mobility model and Langevin recombination model are used in this example as well.
</p>
<p>
Transfer matrix method is activated in the
<b>  BEAM</b> statement by setting
<b>  TR.MAT </b> to correctly simulate coherent effects of light.
</p>
<p>
After setting DC biases of each detector, wavelength ramping is performed from
0.4 to 0.75 um under 50 uW/cm2 illumination power density for each monochromatic
light beam.
</p>
<p>
External quantum efficiency and the sensitiviy of each detector are
extracted from the spectral file. It should be noted that there exist dense ripples upon
the envelope of the spectral response because of the optical interference effect.
