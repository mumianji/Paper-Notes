This example compares I-V curves generated using the Pasveer hopping mobility
model [1] with using a constant mobility model when using a Gaussian energy
distribution of band states.  It also shows the effects of electron
concentration throughout the device for different structure bias.  An
explanation of the Pasveer mobility model together with the gaussian energy
density of states distribution and diffusion models is briefly described below.
</p>
<b> Gaussian Density of States Energy Band Structure</b> <p>
It has been found that the band structure of organic materials is better
represented by a gaussian energy distribution for the density of states rather
than using the normal parabolic energy distribution of states used for
crystalline semiconductor materials.  The average eneregy level cited for the
equivilent &quot;valence&quot; and &quot;conduction&quot; bands in organic materials, is therefore
in the middle of the gaussian energy distribution, rather than at the band
edges of the distribution as in the case for ordered crystalline materials.
</p>
<p>
A gaussian energy band distribution is specified on the material statement,
where for the conduction band, the total density of states is specified by
setting the
<b> NtC.gauss </b> parameter and the width of the gaussian distribution is set by the
<b> SigC.gauss </b> parameter.  Two analagous parameters are also avalable for the valence band.
</p>
<b> Pasveer Hopping Mobility Model [1]</b> <p>
Also demonstrated in the example is the Pasveer hopping mobility model [1],
which was developed to be used in conjuction with the Gaussian energy
distribution of the density of states.  In an analagous way to mobility models
in crystalline materials, the Pasveer model makes the mobility dependent on
both the fraction of filled states (similar to the conmob model in silicon)
and the electric field (similer to fldmob).
</p>
<p>
To activate the Pasveer hopping mobility model for electrons, specify
<b> Pasveer.N </b> on the mobility statement.  The parameter that determines the maximum carrier
density used in the carrier dependent mobility model is specified using the
<b> CCutoff.N </b> parameter, and the analagous maximum field used in the field dependent
mobility model is specified using the
<b> FCutoff.N </b> parameter.  Once again there are analagous parameters for the valence band.
</p>
<b> Diffusion Model </b> <p>
The diffusion model resulting from a gaussian distribution of states
necessitates a corrective term to the Einstein diffusion relationship which
is also included in the models.
