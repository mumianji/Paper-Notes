  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The file starts with the
<b> SET </b> statement which defines the thickness variables for substitution into Atlas syntax. This is followed by defining the OLED structure such as the mesh, region, electrode location and doping.
This is a three layer device consisting of the MEH-PPV polymer film sandwiched between an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate and a metal. The ITO is the anode while the cathode is made up of metal.
In addition, the polymer film is p-type doped with a uniform concentration of 1e15 cm-3.
</p>
<p>
After the device description, the
<b> MATERIAL </b> statement is used to specify the material properties of the ITO and also the MEH-PPV material. In the first
<b> MATERIAL </b> statement, the
<b> REAL.INDEX </b> parameter is used to set the real refractive index (which is directly related to the absorption coefficient) of the ITO. In the second
<b> MATERIAL </b> statement,
<b> AFFINITY</b> specifies the polymer LUMO level and
<b> EG300 </b> specifies the bandgap of the polymer. This gives a HOMO level of 4.9eV (i.e. HOMO level =
<b> EG300 + AFFINITY</b> ).
<b> RST.EXCITON </b> specifies the exciton singlet to triplet ratio of the polymer. This parameter is a key factor in determining the ultimate limit of the OLED efficiency.
<b> TAUS.EXCITON </b> specifies the singlet exciton lifetime and
<b> LDS.EXCITON </b> specifies the singlet exciton diffusion length.
</p>
<p>
Other material parameters of the polymer such as bandgap, density of state (Nc and Nv), relative permittivity, lifetimes, Richardson constant
and real refractive index are also specified in this statement.
</p>
<p>
After the
<b> MATERIAL </b> statements, the
<b> MOBILITY </b> statement is used to set the polymer mobility parameters for the Poole-Frenkel-like mobility model. Parameters such as the
<b> DELTAEN.PFMOB </b> and
<b> DELTAEP.PFMOB </b> specify the thermal activation energy of the organic polymer at zero electric field for electrons and holes respectively, while
<b> BETAN.PFMOB </b> and
<b> BETAP.PFMOB </b> specify the electron and hole Poole-Frenkel factor respectively.
<b> MUN </b> and
<b> MUP </b> are used to set the low field electron and hole mobilities respectively.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> CONTACT </b> statements are used to specify the workfunction of metal and ITO at the cathode and the anode respectively. The first
<b> CONTACT </b> statement specifies a workfunction of 2.9eV (equivalent to Calcium) at the cathode. This forms an electron-injection barrier of 0.1eV (i.e. Ca workfunction - polymer affinity) at the cathode.
The second
<b> CONTACT </b> statement specifies the workfunction of ITO as 4.7eV. This forms a hole-injection barrier of 0.2eV given the polymer HOMO level of 4.9eV. The
<b> NEW.SCHOTT </b> option specifies a heterojunction thermionic tunneling model to be used, while the
<b> AUTO.OHMIC </b> option automatically converts the contact to ohmic when there is no barrier.
</p>
<p>
In the
<b> MODELS </b> statements, several organic models are used such the Poole-Frenkel-like mobility model (
<b>PFMOB</b> ), the Langevin bimolecular recombination model (
<b> LANGEVIN</b> ) and the singlet exciton model (
<b> SINGLET</b> ). The
<b> PFMOB </b> and
<b> LANGEVIN </b> models account for the transport and recombination mechanism of the polymer, while the
<b> SINGLET </b> model is used to calculate the radiative rate for luminescence due to the Langevin recombination in the OLED. The
<b> PRINT </b> option prints the status of all models, coefficients, and constants in the runtime output window.
</p>
<p>
After specifying the structure, an initial solution is first performed with the
<b> SOLVE INIT </b> statement. This is followed by biasing the anode to 10V. Here, the luminous wavelength
<b> L.WAVE </b> is set in the
<b> SOLVE </b> statement so that the luminous power can be extracted during the ramp. A
<b> PROBE </b> statement is included to probe the maximum electric field of the device at x = 5um.
</p>
<p>
The current density versus voltage and the current density versus electric field data are then extracted via the
<b> EXTRACT </b> statement. After extracting the data, these data are plotted with the
<b> TONYPLOT </b> statements.
For the first plot of current density versus voltage, you should select to display &quot;anode bias&quot; along the x axis and &quot;anode current&quot; along the y axis.
The second plot shows the current density versus the electric field.
</p>
<p>
The third plot is the Luminescent power of the OLED. In this figure, it is
seen that the device &quot;turns-on&quot; at about 2 Volts.  Finally, the contour plot
of the Langevin recombination at 10V is displayed.  In this case, most of the
radiative recombination is seen to be confined within the polymer layer
close to the cathode.
