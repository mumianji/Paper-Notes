The IV curves of hole-only sandwich-type devices containing a blue-emitting
polyï¬‚uorene-based copolymer are simulated for a wide range of temperatures and
for several thicknesses of the active organic layer based on [1]. In [1] it is
shown that IV curves cannot be accurately describe using a commonly used mobility
model which only depend on the electric field but that a consistent and quantitatively
precise description of all curves can only be obtained using an extended Gaussian
disorder model EGDM [2]. In this model, the mobility depends on the electric field
and on the carrier concentration.Please refer to organicex05 for a detailed description
and simulation of the EGDM model implementation.
</p>
<p>
The device under test is a single hole-only layer device. The input deck is parametrized
so that the variation of temperature and active layer thickness can be simulated easily
using the internal Design of Experiment feature of deckbuild. Model parameters
are set in the input deck using Table 1 from [1] and Low carrier density and low
electric field mobility model is defined as mu0(T) = mu0 * exp(-C * (sigma/kT)^2)
(see equation 6 in [1]). The &quot;baseline&quot; input deck is named organixex06_aux.in and
in organicex06.in, simulations are performed in order to reproduce Fig2, Fig3(b),
Fig5(c) and Fig5(d) from [1]. Even if a direct comparison with measurement is not
done a very good agreement is obtained for the full range of temperature and
thicknesses.

Linear search damping is activated with the
<b> ls.damping</b> parameter in the
<b> method</b> statement.
<b> lsd.skip.iter </b> is the number of Newton iterations that occurs before linear search damping is
used. This is an alternative to the default Newton iteration scheme and shouldn&apos;t
be used in all cases, but helps convergence in this case.
