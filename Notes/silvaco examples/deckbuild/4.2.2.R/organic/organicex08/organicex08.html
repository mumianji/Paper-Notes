In this example we simulate a 3-layer device with Alq3/Alq3:DCJTB/NPB
similar to that described in [1]
</p>
<p>
Photon emission model:
</p>
<p>
We use the Holstein model for the Alq3 and DCJTB spectra in both the electron
transport and the emissive layers. The model is parameterized by the exciton-phonon
coupling and the exciton hopping energies. The former is set to 1.61 for Alq3.
This value was taken from  [2].
</p>
<p>
For DCJTB this number is not available from experiments. We used a slightly
higher number than Alq3 since we expect excitons to be localized on DCJTB.
</p>
<p>
The homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings were derived by fitting to
experimental data in [2] for Alq3 and then similar broadenings were used for DCJTB.
</p>
<p>
The additional Stokes shift due to reorganization energy was also used as an
additional parameter to properly align the emission and absorption spectra with
experiment [2].
</p>
<p>
Photon Propagation model:
</p>
<p>
We use the transfer matrix method to propagate the light from emissive layers
to the outside. Emission is modeled as Hertzian dipoles placed uniformly across
the thickness of the layer, and added incoherently. We observe a strong modification
of spontaneous emission lifetime of the dipole due to the presence of interfaces
and metal electrode. This is plotted as the average Purcell factor, which is produced
by weighing the Purcell factors of each dipole according to the amount of light it
emits in free space.
</p>
<p>
The strong modification of spontaneous emission lifetime must also be fed back into
the drift diffusion model. At present, ATLAS is not capable of doing this.
</p>
<p>
Modification of spontaneous emission lifetime is higher in ETL layer than in EML layer
due to the vicinity of ETL to metal electrode.
