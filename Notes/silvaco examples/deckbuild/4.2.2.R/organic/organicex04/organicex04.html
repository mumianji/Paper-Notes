A conventional 2 layer organic light emitting diode consists of a Hole
Transport Layer (HTL) and an electron transport layer (ETL). A good OLED
structure requires sufficient carrier injection so that large exciton density
is generated when the carriers recombine. However, a 2-layer OLED structure
has a low injection current due to the poor metal/organic material interface
and therefore has a low device output efficiency. Commercial OLED structures
are multi-layers and this example compare 2 layers versus 3-layers OLED.

This example is based on the following reference:

J.Staudigel et al, &quot;A quantitative numerical model of multilayer vapor-deposited
organic light emitting diodes&quot; Journal of Applied Physics Vol. 86, Number 7
October 1999

In the first part on this example a hole-only unipolar organic device is simulated
and simulation result is compared to measurement. Schottky contacts are defined
for both anode and cathode electrodes and defect states are defined whithin the
organic material using the
<b> odefect </b> statement. A good fit is obtained between simulation and measurement.
</p>
<p>
The second part of the deck compare a 2 layers OLED versus a 3 layers OLED.
</p>
<p>
To demonstrate why the 3-layer OLED has a higher efficiency than a 2-layer device,
we need to take into account interface defect between organic/organic material. To
do so we have defined interface defect states using the
<b> ointdefect </b> statement combined with interface thermionic emission model.
The main effect of the organic/organic interface is to add trap states which reduces
the energy barrier height and enhance carriers injection.
</p>
<p>
Simulation results indeed show thatthe 3 layers OLED has a lower anode current
as expected but a higher luminescent power due to higher Langevin recombination rate.
The same simulations done without interface defect states show opposite behavior (i.e
luminescent power is higher in 2 layers OLED).
