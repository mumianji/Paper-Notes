This example demonstrates 2D Monte Carlo device modeling of a silicon
n-MOSFET without quantum correction.
</p>
<p>
The first part of the input file specifies the algorithmic parameters of the
Monte Carlo model.  Many of the same parameters specified in the
input file for the bulk example (mcdeviceex01)
are used again here.  In this case,
the number of computational carriers (electrons) is set to 40,000 with the
<b> N </b> parameter on the
<b> PARTICLE </b> statement.
<b> N </b> = 40000 is large enough to adequately sample
the spatial distribution of mobile charge in the device.
To better sample the tail of the distribution function, use a
higher value of
<b> N </b> or statistical enhancement.
</p>
<p>
On the
<b> ALGO </b> statement,
<b> DT</b> = 0.1e-15 s = 0.1 fs is ten times smaller than in the bulk example
since the electrons must sense small variations in the 2D doping and
field profiles.  To get even closer to the steady-state solution,
change from
<b> ITER </b> = 2500 to
<b> ITER</b> = 25000.  With this change, MCDEVICE will take about 10
times longer to run the example, but the averages will be closer
to the steady-state solution.  As in the bulk case, you may want
to change from
<b> TRANS</b> = 0 to
<b> TRANS</b> = 1000 to obtain a more
accurate solution before TIME = 0 when MCDEVICE begins collecting data
for its averages.
We have kept this example short by using
<b> ITER</b> = 2500 and
<b> TRANS</b> = 0
so you can experience running a complete simulation in just a couple
of minutes.
</p>
<p>
In this case,
<b> TSTEP</b> = 5
on the
<b> POISSON </b> statement indicates that Poisson&apos;s equation will be solved every 5 iterations
(or every 5 *
<b> DT</b> = 0.5 fs).  This time must remain short in order for the
electrons to properly
sample spatial and temporal variations of the electric fields.
</p>
<p>
The second part of the input file specifies a rectangular tensor product
mesh used
to represent the physical structure of the device,
to solve Poisson&apos;s equation,
and to help enforce the MC carrier boundary conditions.
A finer mesh captures more
carrier-carrier interaction.  A courser mesh captures less
carrier-carrier interaction.  In this example, we use a typical size
of the 2D mesh for a 25-nm n-MOSFET.  This 2D mesh is finer
than what is typically used when solving for the steady-state
solution of the drift diffusion or energy balance equations for the
same device.
</p>
<p>
The third part of the input file specifies rectangular regions
on the mesh.  The REGION statements indicate both the
material (MAT parameter) and type of region (TYPE parameter).
When you specify the regions in your input file, always
include regions with the TYPE of OUT, MC, BLOCK, and CONTACT.
Please see the MCDEVICE chapter of the Atlas User&apos;s Manual for
a complete description of
the region types and how they control the Monte
Carlo solution.
</p>
<p>
The fourth part of the input file specifies the rectangular current
regions used to estimate the current in the device.  In this case,
the x-directed estimates of
the current (dim=1 values in the mcdeviceex02_current.log file)
from the first and third regions represent the terminal currents at
the source and drain, respectively.
</p>
<p>
The fifth part of the input file specifies the doping profiles.
</p>
<p>
The last part of the input file includes a
<b> SOLVE </b> statement.  The
<b> SOLVE </b> statement performs the Monte Carlo solve at the voltage biases
provided by the
<b> V&lt;NAME&gt; </b> parameters on the
<b> SOLVE </b> statement.
Additional commented
<b> SOLVE </b> statements may be
used to do perform voltage ramps
or obtained solutions at other bias points.
