This example demonstrates 2D Monte Carlo device modeling of a silicon
n-MOSFET with quantum correction.
</p>
<p>
For all aspects of this example apart from the quantum correction,
please see the previous example, mcdeviceex02.
</p>
<p>
The aspects of this example related to the quantum correction are
specified with three different statements.
</p>
<p>
On the
<b> QREGION </b> statement,
the
<b> BOUNDP </b> parameter specifies a rectangular domain where
the quantum correction is included.
In this case, the quantum correction is included just under the gate.
<b> DIR</b> = Y
on the
<b> QREGION </b> statement specifies the
direction of quantization.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> SCHRMESH </b> statement specifies the number and location of nodes used for the
Schroedinger mesh.  The Schroedinger equation is solved
on the 1D mesh specified here at every
<b> XSTEP</b> = 1
mesh lines along X
and at every
<b> TSTEP</b> = 4000
iterations.  Undersampling the quantum solution either
spatially or temporally may reduce the accuracy of the solution.
This choice
was found to be adequate for this device
and is a reasonable starting point for modeling other devices.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> SCHRREGION </b> statement specifies the material regions
used for the quantum correction.
You must specify these material definitions using
<b> SCHRREGION </b> statements consistently with the material definitions
you specified on the 2D Poisson mesh using
<b> REGION </b> statements.
In this example, although MCDEVICE obtains non-zero values of the
electrons&apos; wave functions in the SiO2 region,
MCDEVICE confines the MC electrons to the silicon substrate.
As a result,
the &quot;Electron Conc&quot; and &quot;Average Electron Conc&quot; fields in the
mcdeviceex03_sol.str file
do not show electrons in the SiO2 even though electron penetration of
oxide barrier is considered as part of the model.
This choice is conventional.
The model does a good job of predicting
the impact of quantum size effects on the electron concentration
and the terminal currents.
