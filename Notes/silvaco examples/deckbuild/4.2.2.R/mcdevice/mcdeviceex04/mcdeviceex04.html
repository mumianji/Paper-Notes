This example demonstrates 2D Monte Carlo device modeling of a silicon
p-MOSFET without quantum correction.
</p>
<p>
For all aspects of this example apart from the quantum correction,
please see mcdeviceex02.
</p>
<p>
This example was generated by changing all n-type dopants to
p-type dopants, all p-type dopants to n-type dopants,
and by negating all applied bias voltages.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> CARRIER </b> parameter on the
<b> ALGO </b> statement is changed from
<b> CARRIER </b> = E for electrons (as in mcdeviceex02) to
<b> CARRIER</b> = H for holes.  This means that holes are modeled using
the Monte Carlo transport model and electrons are modeled using
the constant quasi-Fermi method.  In mcdeviceex02,
these choices are reversed.
</p>
<p>
In additional, the
<b> PHON</b> ,
<b> BANDS</b> ,
and
<b> FINAL </b> statements are
added near the end of the input file (just before the
<b> SOLVE </b> statement).  These three statements are provided here
to change to settings
consistent with
<b> CARRIER</b> = H.
The default values for these three statements are
are consistent with
<b> CARRIER</b> = E.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the x-component of the currents produced by the
p-MOSFET are negative while the x-component of the current
produced by the n-MOSFET were positive.  This is as expected and
follows the sign conventions for the current
described in the &quot;Current Regions&quot; section of the MCDEVICE
chapter of the Atlas User&apos;s Manual.
