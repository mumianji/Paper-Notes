This example demonstrates the simulation of electron transport
in bulk n-type silicon with a single value
of the doping and the electric field.
</p>
<p>
This example shows how to set bulk material properties,
the number of iterations, the MC time step, and the
number of carriers (i.e., electrons).
This example also shows
how to obtain estimates of the bulk mobility.
This example introduces the bulk mode of MCDEVICE and basic
concepts of modeling charge transport in bulk semiconductors.
</p>
<p>
The bulk material properties are set on the
<b> BULK </b> statement. The
<b> FIELD </b> parameter and the
<b> DOPING </b> parameter are the most commonly used.
In this case, a low field with no doping is chosen
to model the behavior of mobile electrons in intrinsic silicon in the
linear region of the velocity-field characteristic.
</p>
<p>
The number of iterations and duration of the time step are
set on the
<b> ALGO </b> statement.
The
<b> ITER </b> parameter implies that mobility estimates
in the mcdeviceex1_diff.log file are averaged over
of TIME = (
<b> ITER</b> -
<b> TRANS</b> ) *
<b> DT</b> = (10000-0)*(1e-15 s) = 10e-12 s = 10 ps.
To improve the estimates, increase
<b> TRANS</b> , which is the number of transient iterations performed before
TIME=0 when MCDEVICE begins to collect data for the averages.
The number of computational carriers used in the Monte Carlo model
is determined by the
<b> N </b> parameter on the
<b> PARTICLE </b> statement.  For bulk simulations,
<b> N </b> represents the
ensemble size used to collect data.  The magnitude of
the noise of the averages will be reduced both by increasing the
size of the ensemble and by increasing the time during
which data is collected, namely (
<b> ITER</b> -
<b> TRANS</b> ) *
<b> DT</b> ).
</p>
<p>
The mobility estimates along with other time-averaged quantities are
written into the mcdeviceex01_diff.log file.  You can plot these
with TonyPlot.  The best estimate for the mobililty
is obtained when drift-derived and diffusion-derived
estimates converge.
