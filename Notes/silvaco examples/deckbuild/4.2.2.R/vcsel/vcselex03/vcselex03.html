The first half of the input file describes the Atlas structual syntax,
including the mesh, region electrode and doping commands that are also common
to other Atlas examples.  LASER specific structual commands include the
powerful DBR statements which allow the definition of the numerous
periodic semiconductor hetero-structure layers that make up the two mirrors of
a VCSEL and it&apos;s active region respectively, each in a single line of the input
file.  VCSELs are modelled using a pseudo-3D method which assumes the device
has cylindrical geometry and symetry.  This is activated using the MESH CYL
statement.  The point X=0 represents the center of the device.  The mesh
statements define the mesh in the X direction only.  Mesh in the Y direction is
defined using SY=&lt;n&gt; parameter the REGION statements.  This creates &quot;n&quot; number
of mesh points in the Y direction in the region to which it refers.  DBR
statements also contain Y mesh parameters and are described below.
</p>
<p>
The REGION statements contain &quot;TOP&quot; or &quot;BOTTOM&quot; parameters to define the
location of the region.  The device can therefore have the new region being
defined attached to either the top or bottom of the device.  Donor or acceptor
doping can also be assigned in each region statement using the DONOR=&lt;n&gt; or
ACCEPT=&lt;n&gt; parameters respectively.
</p>
<p>
The Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs) are defined using the DBR statement.
The DBR statement allows the definition of a mirrors consisting of alternating
layers of two materials with differing refractive index.  The number of layers
is defined by the HALF.CYC=&lt;n&gt; parameter.  The thickness of each type of layer
is defined by the THICK1=&lt;n&gt; and THICK2=&lt;n&gt; parameters respectively.  The
number of mesh points in the Y direction are defined by the N1=&lt;n&gt; and N2=&lt;n&gt;
parameters respectively.  The materials of each layer are defined by the
MAT1=&lt;material&gt; and MAT2=&lt;material&gt; parameters.  Mole fractions for ternary and
quaternary materials are defined by X1.COMP=&lt;n&gt;, X2.COMP=&lt;n&gt; Y1.COMP=&lt;n&gt; and
Y2.COMP=&lt;n&gt; parameters.  Donor or acceptor doping is defined by ND1=&lt;n&gt;,
ND2=&lt;n&gt;, NA1=&lt;n&gt; and NA2=&lt;n&gt; parameters respectively.
</p>
<p>
The active region of the VCSEL consists of one or more quantum wells.  In this
example, the active region contains 6 wells that are defined by the QWELL
parameter on the associated REGION statements.  The sampling for Schrodinger
solutions is given by the WELL.NX and WELL.NY parameters of the REGION
statement.  The gain model for the active quantum wells is specified by the
LI parameter on the MODEL statement.  The SPONT parameter specifies that
the gain model will be used to model spontaneous recombination.
</p>
<p>
In order to maximize their reflectivity, the DBRs must be defined such that
intensity peaks and troughs of the standing wave light pattern fall at the
boundary between the two dissimilar semiconductors.  The standing wave light
pattern for each mode is a function of the light propogation velocity and the
thickness of each layer of the DBR.  The ratio of light propogation velocity in
a vacuum compared to each layer in the DBR is given by the refractive index,
which in turn is the square root of the permittivity of the material at the
wavelengths concerned.  The permittivity of each semiconductor is defined by
the ESPINF=&lt;n&gt; parameter in the MATERIAL statement.  It should be noted that
this is the optical permittivity which can be significantly lower than the
permittivity at electrical frequencies.  The thermal properties of the
materials, necessary for calculating local temperature rises, are also defined
on the material statement in common with other thermal simulations.
</p>
<p>
Heat loss from the device is defined using thermal contacts in the THERMCONTACT
statement in the usual way, which specifies thermal conductivities to simulate
heat loss from radiation via exposed surfaces or conduction through the
semiconductor to a heatsink.
</p>
<p>
Once the structure has been defined, a number of parameters regarding the
photonic equations are defined in the VCSEL statement.  The photonic energy
range over which the user wishes to look for standing wave patterns is defined
by the EINIT=&lt;n&gt; and EFINAL=&lt;n&gt; parameters.  There is little point in
investigating photonic energies less than the bandgap of the active region,
as these will not lase.
</p>
<p>
During execution the program stores structure files at various biases
so that the user can track which standing wave pattern has the most
gain both before and after lasing occurs.  The standing wave pattern
associated with lasing in the fundamental mode usually consists of an
envelope function with a single large peak of light output located at
the active region.  Lasing is also associated with a sudden constancy
of the optical gain with bias which can be plotted in TonyPlot using
the creatd LOG FILE.  Typical parameters that can be viewd in TonyPlot
using the created structure and log files are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 DC I-V diode characteristics
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Light power versus electrical bias
<br/>

  <li>

<br/>
  </li>
  <li>

<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
