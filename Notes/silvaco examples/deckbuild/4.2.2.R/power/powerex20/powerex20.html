This example is taken from the Silvaco Simulation Standard Article:
&quot;Vertical LOCOS Power Devices in Victory Process: From 3D Process and
Electrical Optimisation to High Speed, Full Chip Process Emulation, Volume
25, Number 2, April - May - June 2015&quot;
</p>
<p>
The example creates a simplified process flow in Victory Process for a
curved corner vertical LOCOS MOS power device, the structure is then
exported and passed into Victory Device for electrical simulation.
</p>
<p>
The simulation is initialised with a heavily doped N+ layer, this forms the
N+ Drain. Once the volume mesh is defined, a thick N-type layer is deposited
with a doping of 8E15cm3 followed by a P-type layer of 1E17cm3 which form
the N-drift and P-base (source) respectively.
</p>
<p>
SPECIFYMASKPOLY is then used to define the masks for etching the trench. Two
masks are defined to create the trench outline, they are then merged using a
Boolean OR operation on them.
</p>
<p>
Thin oxide and nitride layers are then deposited, the former for the thin
gate oxide, the latter to stop oxide growth in subsequent thermal steps.
</p>
<p>
As a short cut, the single mask set defined previously is used to etch away
unnecessary parts of these layers and form the deep trench. The DELTACD
parameter is used to shift the dimensions of the mask layer.
</p>
<p>
Once the thick oxide is grown, polysilicon is used to fill the trench and
defined as an electrode.
</p>
<p>
Finally the device is exported using an unstructured delaunay mesh. The base
mesh size is set at 0.2um. mesh refinement is then undertaken on distance to
interface with polysilicon to provide drift region refinement along the edge
of the thick oxide. Refinement is also undertaken on the P/N junction.
Finally a refinement box is defined over the N-Drift/N+ Drain transition.
</p>
<p>
The exported structure is then passed to Victory Device, a bias is applied
to the device and ramped up. Complience is set such that the simulation
stops when breakdown is achieved. The EXTRACT statement is used to print out
the value of breakdown voltage.
