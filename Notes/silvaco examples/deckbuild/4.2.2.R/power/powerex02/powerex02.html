This example demonstrates fabrication and electrical analysis of a
vertical DMOS structure.  It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 DMOS process flow to generate the device structure using Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Model setup for non-isothermal device simulation using Giga
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Atlas methodology for simulating the DMOS device gate characteristics
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The structure generated by Athena is a silicon vertical DMOS device.  A phosphorus doped silicon substrate
and underlying mesh are defined.  A lightly phosphorous doped silicon epitaxial layer is then grown using the
<b> epitaxy </b> command.  The gate material is deposited, patterned and etched.  Boron is implanted and diffused to form the right
edge of channel region under the gate.  The source region arsenic implant is performed and diffused to complete the
channel definition.  Aluminum is deposited and etched to form the source contact.  The source, drain and gate electrodes
are defined by using the
<b> electrode </b> statement and by including the name and location of the contact on the command line.  Notice that the drain electrode
location is defined by the &apos;electrode&apos; command line option
<b> backside</b> .  Now that the structure has been completed, the Atlas device test can be performed.
</p>
<p>
In this simulation, the structure created by Athena will be automatically loaded into Atlas when the command
<b> go atlas </b> is reached.  The
<b> contact </b> statement sets the workfunction for the gate to that of degenerately doped n-type polysilicon.  Next, the
<b> models </b> statement sets the physical transport and associated models to be used, in this case, conmob: concentration dependent
mobility, fldmob: lateral electric field dependent mobility, srh: Shockly-Read-Hall recombination, and most importantly
for power devices, lat.temp:  non-isothermal transport using Giga.  The thermal boundary condition for the source contact
is defined by the
<b> thermcontact </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The gate characteristics of this DMOS device are calculated by solving the transport and thermal equations at the
bias specified in the
<b> solve </b> statements.  Here, the drain bias is stepped to 20 volts.  Next, an output logfile is opened using the
<b> log </b> command, and the gate contact is ramped from 0.25 volts to 20 volts in two stages.  It is advisable to use smaller bias
steps initially.  Larger bias steps can then be used for the remaining bias range.
TonyPlot plots the gate characteristics from the log file.  To plot the structure and solution at the final bias point,
highlight the name &apos;powerex02_2.str&apos; on the
<b> save </b> command line and click left &apos;Tools&apos; at the top right of the DeckBuild window.
