By default Victory Process and Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot;</b> could be specidied in the
<b> go</b> line starting Victory Process or Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
This example demonstrates the creation of a
<b> buffered super junction LDMOS.</b> </p>
<b> Super junctions </b> <p>
are used in LDMOS structures to
<b> greatly increase the breakdown voltage </b> of small geometry devices
by allowing the drain depletion region to spread in two dimensions
instead of one at higher drain voltages
(the additional direction being laterally across the super junction).
The nett result is that the drain voltage can now be spread across
a much greater total distance than would otherwise be the case,
which greatly lowers the field at the drain
and therefore increases the breakdown voltage.
</p>
<p>
Another advantage of super junction technology is that the n doped stripes
in the super junction can be doped to higher concentrations
because the important depletion distance is now the lateral distance
between the super junction stripes (determined largely by the technology node)
rather than the full depletion width of the drain.
Higher doping yields lower on resistance, increasing current drive
over a standard construction design with a similar breakdown voltage.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> buffered </b> super junction device takes this technology one step further
by including an additional n-doped buffer layer under the super junction,
which increases the breakdown voltage to even higher values
by expanding the depletion region in the remaining third dimension
which is down into the depth of the substrate.
This example demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach
as it has an electrical gate length of only 2.5um
but its breakdown voltage is 95 volts.
