The Atlas simulation begins with the definition of the IGBT structure.
Atlas is used to define the IGBT structure including mesh, materials, electrodes, and doping.
A fine rectangular mesh is first defined.  Next the materials are assigned to specific regions using the
<b> region </b> command.  The electrodes and doping profiles are then defined.  Additionally, specific characteristics of these materials, their electrodes and the charge carriers within can be modified.  The
<b> material </b> statement is
used to define the electron and hole recombination lifetimes in the semiconductor.  The
<b> contact </b> statement defines the workfunction of the polysilicon electrode, in this case, that of degenerately doped n-type polysilicon.   This completes the IGBT structure definition.
</p>
<p>
For any Atlas device simulation, the physical transport models must be enabled using the
<b> model </b> statement.  In this case, they reflect the different physical effects important to the IGBT device.
They are analytic: analytic concentration dependent mobility, fldmob: lateral electric field dependent mobility, surfmob: surface mobility degradation, srh:
Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, and auger:  recombination accounting for high level injection
effects.
</p>
<p>
IGBT output characteristics are simulated by sweeping the collector contact voltage for several discrete values
of gate voltage.  In this example, the collector voltage will be swept from 0 to 20 V for gate voltages of 5
and 10 V.  This is accomplished by first obtaining a solution at each gate bias of interest with all other
electrodes set to 0V.  Next, each gate solution is used as the initial solution for a collector sweep.
Output log files are saved for each gate-collector sweep combination.  TonyPlot displays the IGBT Ic / Vce
family of curves by overlaying all output curves on one plot.
