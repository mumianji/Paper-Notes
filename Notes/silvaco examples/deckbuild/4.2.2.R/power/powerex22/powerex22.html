By default Victory Process and Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot;</b> could be specidied in the
<b> go</b> line starting Victory Process or Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
This example demonstrates
<b> 2D </b> process simulation and basic device tests for a  U-shaped trench MOSFET or
<b> UMOS</b> .
</p>
<p>
UMOS device belongs to family of Vertical MOSFET devices which differ from standard (horizontal)
MOSFETs by the fact that the gate is &quot;vertical&quot; and the drain is on the bottom
of device. In UMOS, the vertical gate is formed by etching and oxidizing of a deep trench in silicon.
The device uses two connections to the source which results in much larger area
through which the current can flow. This reduces the ON resistance of the device which
allow to handle higher powers than standard MOSFETs. The vertical nature of the UMOS
structure allows to achieve good device characteristics with smaller &quot;layout footprint&quot;
than conventional power MOSFETs.
</p>
<p>
Since UMOS is a symmetrical device only half of the structure is simulated. The full structure is later generated using
<b> Mirror</b> capability within
<b> Victory Mesh</b> .
</p>
<p>
Most of important geomentrical and process parameters of the UMOS structure are parametrized using
<b> set </b> capability of
<b> DeckBuild</b> which allows easy process and device optimization using
<b> VWF.</b> </p>
<p>
The key process step, the trench formation, is simulated by combination of
two etch models:
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 geometrical 
<b> angled dry </b> etch
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 geometrical
<b> wet </b> etch with the curvature of the trench bottom specified by
<b> RADIUS</b> <br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This deck takes advantage of Victory Process capability of adjusting volume
mesh for specific implant/diffusion steps. It starts with a very coarse volume mesh
which allow to speed up epitaxy and trench formation steps. Then additional volume mesh
<b> lines</b> are placed in important areas around the trench as well as in implanted areas. Also, the fine
grid initially required to capture a sharp peak of N+ Arsenic implant was later coarsened
by using
<b> Line remove</b> capability of Victory Process.
</p>
<p>
In this example, in order to decrease simulation time the default analytical model is used
for all implant steps. The Monte Carlo implant model is recommended for most real device simulation.
</p>
<p>
Several parameters of the device structure are extracted along the way and can be used
for process optimization.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the full structure is &quot;prepared&quot; for device simulation using
<b> Victory Mesh</b> .
First, the final status of Victory process simulation is loaded, then the structure is mirrored, and remeshhed and refined using
<b> Delaunay</b> mesh.  The finest refinement takes place along the gate to obtain reproducible Vt. The nesh is also refined at other interfaces and along the junction for accurate Breakdown Voltage simulation.
</p>
<p>
In the end Victory Device is used to extract two basic device characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Threshold voltage
<b> Vt</b> <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Breakdown voltage 
<b> BV</b> .
  </li>
</ul>
