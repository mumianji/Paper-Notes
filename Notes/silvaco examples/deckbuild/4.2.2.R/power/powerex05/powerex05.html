This example demonstrates the fabrication and electrical
analysis of a protection structure using guard rings.  It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>

<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Proper guard ring contact definition for breakdown analysis using Atlas
<br/>
   </li>
  <li>
 Transport model definition including impact ionization

  <li>
 Breakdown test definition
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The breakdown structure considered here consists of a series of four guard rings sandwiched between cathode and
anode electrodes.  The Athena simulation begins by defining a phosphorous doped silicon substrate and its
associated mesh.  Silicon dioxide is then deposited and etched to expose silicon for guard ring and anode
implantation.  Boron is implanted and diffused to define the guard ring and anode junction depth.  Boron
doped polysilicon is then deposited and etched to form the guard ring plate electrodes.  Aluminum is deposited
and etched to create the anode and cathode electrodes.  These electrodes are specified using the
<b> electrode </b> statement.  This includes the name and position.  Notice that a substrate electrode is added by specifying the
<b> backside </b> option.  The completed structure is saved and plotted using TonyPlot.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas breakdown simulation is now described.  In this simulation, the structure created by Athena will be
automatically
loaded into Atlas when the command
<b> go atlas </b> is reached.  For this breakdown simulation including guard rings, the guard ring contact must be allowed to float.  The
<b> contact </b> statement specifies that a 1E20 ohm series resistor be added to each contact.  This allows each guard ring
contact to float and ensures that there is no appreciable current flow.  The
<b> bipolar </b> option to the
<b> models </b> statement selects a default set of transport models for bipolar devices.  The default bipolar models are
conmob: concentration dependent mobility, fldmob: lateral electric field dependent mobility, bgn: band gap
narrowing effects, consrh: concentration dependent Shockley-Read-Hall recombination lifetimes, and
auger: recombination accounting for high level injection effects.  Since breakdown in semiconductor devices can
occur in the presence of impact ionization, this model should be enabled.  In this case, the
<b> impact selb </b> statement enables the Selberherr impact ionization model.  Please refer to the Atlas user&apos;s manual for a
detailed description of these and other models.
</p>
<p>
When simulating devices with external components like the guard ring  plate resistors, the
<b> newton </b> solution method is required.  When using large bias steps, or when operating a device near breakdown,  it is
advised to specify the
<b> trap </b> option to the
<b> method </b> statement.  With this option enabled, Atlas automatically reduces the applied bias when convergence is not
achieved.  The simulation then continues at this new bias point.  If convergence is achieved, Atlas tries the
original bias point again.  If not, the applied bias is reduced again.  This will  continue until convergence
is achieved or until a maximum number of reductions takes place.  Once convergence occurs, Atlas will
automatically work its way back to the original bias point where the initial reduction occurred.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas
<b> solve </b> statement is now used to construct the breakdown test.  As in most cases, an initial zero bias solution is
performed by selecting the
<b> init </b> option of the
<b> solve </b> statement.  This gives Atlas an initial guess for subsequent simulations.  An output log file is opened and will
contain terminal characteristics for each bias point selected for test or until another output log file is opened.
For this breakdown test, the anode voltage is stepped from -1V to -900V in three stages: -1V to -5V,
-5V to -25V, and -25V to -900V.  This arrangement is designed to provide good convergence while minimizing total
simulation time.
</p>
<p>
The solution at the final bias point is saved as a structure file and TonyPlot is invoked to plot the results.
Anode, cathode and substrate currents can be plotted to identify the voltage where breakdown occurs.  Various
contour quantities such as electric field, potential, and impact generation rate can be displayed from the
structure plot.
