This example simulates the fabrication process and breakdown analysis of a Lateral DMOS
device (LDMOS). The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Process simulation of the LDMOS structure using Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Measurement of layer thickness, 1D Vt and BVdss using EXTRACT
<br/>
    </li>
  <li>
 Auto interface from Athena to Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Atlas simulation of the breakdown voltage BVdss
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The device simulated is an asymmetric LDMOS power device
structure with a 4 micron gate length.  Athena simulation starts by defining an
asymmetric grid with finer grid in the drift region. In preparation for the gate oxide growth, a sacrificial
oxide layer is grown and etched away.  A gate oxide
of 570 Angstroms is then grown.  To ensure adequate grid spacing in the growing oxide, the
<b> method grid.ox </b> statement sets the grid to 100 Angstroms.  After the oxide growth, the
<b> extract </b> statement is used to measure the gate oxide thickness.  The results of the EXTRACT can be found in the DeckBuild
output window and in the file &apos;results.final&apos;.  Check for this file in the directory in which  DeckBuild was
started.  The next step is a low-energy and low-dose boron Vt-adjust
implant.   Poly deposition, poly-gate definition and drift
region implant are then performed. The drift region is masked and n+
phosphorus is implanted into the opened source and drain areas.
</p>
<p>
After the final anneal at 1000 degrees the contact holes are opened,
metal is deposited and patterned. The four electrodes are then
specified.
</p>
<p>
A useful parameter to measure at this stage is the threshold voltage of a 1D
slice through the center of the gate. This is performed via the
<b> extract </b> statement. Since the channel length is fairly long and the channel
doping is uniform laterally, this is a fairly good approximation to the 2D
threshold voltage that Atlas would give.  This ends the LDMOS process simulation.
The resultant structure file is saved and plotted.
</p>
<p>
The structure created by Athena will be automatically loaded into Atlas when the command
<b> go atlas </b> is reached.  The Atlas portion of this example begins by specifying the physical models to be used.  For this
example, they
are cvt:  for transverse field dependent mobility, and srh: Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.
<b> carriers=2 </b> indicates that both holes and electrons will be simulated.  The Selberherr impact ionization model is enabled
using the
<b> impact selb </b> statement.  The
<b> contact </b> statement sets the gate workfunction to that of degenerately doped n-type polysilicon.
Additionally, the
<b> interface </b> statement sets the silicon-silicon dioxide interface charge to 3E10.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> method </b> statement has many purposes.  First, it sets the type of solution methodology, as in this case with the
<b> newton </b> option.  The
<b> trap </b> option enables the reduction in applied bias when convergence is not achieved.  This is an
important feature for large bias steps and simulations near breakdown.  The option
<b> climit=1e-4 </b> improves convergence for breakdown simulation when the pre-breakdown
current is very low. It is recommended for most power device breakdown calculations.  Many other options are
available.  Please consult the Atlas user&apos;s manual for additional information.
</p>
<p>
The sequence of
<b> solve </b> statements ramp the drain voltage from zero to 100V.  For this
particular device, the breakdown voltage is about 50V.  At biases
higher than this, the simulation will fail to converge.  With the
<b> trap </b> option enabled, Atlas will automatically reduce the applied bias until
the convergence criteria is met or until the maximum number of
reductions is reached.
The final
<b> extract </b> statement reads the maximum drain voltage solved from the output log file.
A plot of the Id versus Vds curve in TonyPlot clearly shows the breakdown characteristics. A more
sophisticated technique using the curve tracing algorithm in Atlas is
also possible. This technique is demonstrated in the Advanced MOS
examples section for simulating snapback. Another technique using
compliance limits is described in the MOS examples section under the
NMOS breakdown.
