This example illustrates the simulation of a Gate Turn-Off Thyristor
(GTO).  The device is embedded in a realistic power device circuit. The interaction between the circuit elements
and the active device is important in accurately simulating GTO behavior.  The steady state behavior is simulated
first.  This is used as the initial condition for the transient analysis.  This example shows:

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Atlas is used to define the GTO structure including mesh, materials, electrodes, and doping.
The
<b> mesh rect </b> statement defines a rectangular mesh with grid lines at the locations specified by the
<b> x.m </b> and
<b> y.m </b> statements.  Using the
<b> region </b> statement, the mesh is divided into three regions:  two silicon and one insulator.  The
<b> electrode </b> statement defines the cathode, anode and gate electrodes.  The
<b> doping </b> statements define the doping profiles.  Note the definition of implant type, junction position and characteristic
length.  The net profile is n+ p n p+ from the cathode on top to anode on the bottom.  The gate is contacted to
the p region.  This structure is saved and will be used as a device by MixedMode.
</p>
<p>
In this simulation, the MixedMode circuit simulator uses Atlas to calculate the transient  characteristics of a
GTO under the specified circuit conditions.  First, a steady-state simulation of the GTO circuit is performed.
The
<b> .begin </b> and
<b> .end </b> statements indicate the beginning and end of the MixedMode syntax.  The MixedMode commands are similar to those
used in SmartSpice.   Circuit components, topology, and analysis are defined here.
In general, the circuit component definition consists of three parts: the type of component, the lead or terminal
node assignments, and the component value or model name.  For example, the first component definition in this
simulation is a dc current source.
<b> i1 </b> defines the component as current source number one,
<b> 0 </b> and
<b> 1 </b> are the two circuit nodes for this component and
<b> 400 </b> indicates that the current source value is 400 amps.
</p>
<p>
This circuit can be divided in two parts: input, and output.
The input circuit connects to the cathode and anode of the GTO.  It includes current source
<b> i1</b> , voltage source
<b> v1</b> , resistors
<b> r1 r2 r3</b> , diodes
<b> d1 d2 d3</b> , inductors
<b> l1 l2 l3</b> , and capacitor
<b> c1.  </b> The output or switching circuit connects to the GTO gate and anode and includes voltage sources
<b> v1 v2 v3</b> , diode
<b> d4</b> , resistors
<b> r2 r4</b> , and inductor
<b> l4</b> . The GTO component itself is specified by the
<b> agto </b> statement.  This statement specifies a device to be analyzed by Atlas.  The
<b> a </b> part of the
<b> agto </b> command specifies that this is a device statement.  The
<b> gto </b> portion simply defines the device name.  The option
<b> infile= </b> indicates which device structure file is to be used.  Other command line options exist.  Please refer to the
MixedMode section of the Atlas user&apos;s manual for a complete list.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> .nodeset </b> statement defines the initial values for node voltages and the
<b> .save outfile= </b> statement saves the result to the indicated file.  Since this is the steady state solution, no output log data
file is needed.  Since standard diode parts are used in this circuit, the
<b> .model dd </b> statement is used to specify additional characteristics.  Note that
<b> dd </b> was the model name given in the diode component definition statement.  Additionally, the
<b> .options </b> command sets the solution method to a modified two-level Newton using the
<b> m2ln </b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
To completely specify the simulation, the physical models used by Atlas must be specified.  The
<b> model </b> statement is used to turn on the appropriate transport models.  This set includes analytic: the analytic
concentration dependent mobility model, fldmob: the lateral electric field-dependent mobility model, consrh:
Shockley-Read-Hall recombination using concentration dependent lifetimes, auger: recombination accounting for high level injection
effects, and bgn:
band gap narrowing.  The
<b> material </b> statement is used to override default material parameters.  In this case, the carrier recombination fixed
lifetimes are set and for region three, the permittivity is set to that of air (1).  Finally, an impact ionization
model is enabled using the
<b> impact </b> statement with the
<b> selb </b> option.  This specifies that the Selberherr impact ionization model is to be used.  Note that for each of these
commands, the device name and region can be specified.
</p>
<p>
The final part of this example is the transient simulation of the gate turn-off. The description of the circuit
is similar to the steady state part. The gate turn-off is simulated by pulsing the GTO gate output
resistance r4
from 1 mega-ohm to 1 micro-ohm over 100 ns.  This is defined by the additional command line options on the
<b> r4 </b> command line.  The result of the essentially shorted resistor r4 is that a
negative pulse is applied to the gate which initiates the GTO
turn-off process. The
<b> .tran </b> statement controls the overall transient simulation time.
</p>
<p>
Terminal characteristics of the GTO, circuit node voltages and circuit
element currents are are saved in the
<b> .log </b> file and can be observed with TonyPlot.  The turnoff speed is seen by plotting the GTO anode and
gate current.
