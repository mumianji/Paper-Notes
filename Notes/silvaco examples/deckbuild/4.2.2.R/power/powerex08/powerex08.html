This examples demonstrates a technique used to quickly estimate the
breakdown voltage of any device. It uses the same LDMOS power device
process simulation and structure as in the previous example.
</p>
<p>
Rather than perform a full breakdown analysis by solving for impact
ionization using a two carrier approach, this example uses ionization
integrals. Ionization integrals are based solely on the electric field
strength so zero carrier solutions can be done. The zero carrier option
is specified using
<b> carriers=0</b> . Although impact ionization is not solved directly, the impact model
is used in the postprocessing analysis. For this it is necessary to
specify
<b> impact selb</b> .
</p>
<p>
The ionization integrals are calculated along electric field lines.
Electric field lines are specified during the solution by parameters on the
<b> solve</b> statement. The parameter
<b> deltav </b> specifies an offset between the applied voltage and the voltage at
which the electric field lines will start. The lines should not start
exactly at a contact since the electric field is often zero at the contact.
The
<b> lratio </b> parameter specifies the ratio of spacing between adjacent field lines. A
value less than unity means the lines occur more the left, greater than
unity they occur more to the right. In this example the drain is on the
right of the structure. So the lines should be more towards the high
field area on the left side of the drain. Hence lratio is less than
one.
The locations of the electric field lines can be saved into the solution files.
However the
<b> output </b> statement must be used to specify the electric field line parameters as
in the solve statement. The final plot shows the electric field and the
electric field lines at the breakdown point.
</p>
<p>
The solve sequence in this example uses assigned variables from the
<b> extract </b> statement to closely define the breakdown. The first solve statement ramps the
drain voltage in 5V steps until the ionization integrals exceed one. This means
the breakdown is between this voltage and 5V less than this voltage. The extract
sequence steps the voltage back 5V. The 1V steps are taken until the breakdown
condition is reached and the analysis is repeated. After this, 0.1V steps are used
to give a breakdown number to within 0.1V.
</p>
<p>
Users should note that using this method to extract the breakdown
voltage is only approximate. The algorithm does not consider any
current and hence usually overestimates the actual breakdown voltage.
The advantage over the method in the previous example is speed.
