This example demonstrates modeling of Low-Voltage Power MOSFET
based on the following reference:

<p>
The file starts with the definition of the process flow for a low
voltage MOSFET transistor in Athena. Often a mesh that is used for
process simulation, is not optimal for use with device simulation.
In this example, the mesh generation tool
<b> DevEdit </b> is used to recreate a mesh that has zero obtuse triangles in the
semiconductor region. It is then refined as a function of a number
of solution quantities on the mesh (eg: Nte Doping).
</p>
<p>
Popup windows under the DeckBuild Command window can be used to create
this set of commands to control DevEdit. The DevEdit GUI can be used as
well by loading the structure file from Athena, remeshing it using DevEdit
GUI and saving a DevEdit command file. The mesh syntax from this file can
then be copied and pasted into deckbuild.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas the transfer characteristic is simulated by setting the Drain
Voltage to 25V and ramping the Gate Voltage to 4V. The Threshold Voltage
is adjusted using the
<b> workf </b> parameter from the contact statement.
</p>
<p>
In order to simulate the Breakdown Voltage, the initial Athena structure
has been modified by providing the body region with a contact, thus, ensuring
a short with the source region. This is done directly in Atlas by adding a
body contact using the
<b> electrode name=body x.min=0 x.max=0 y.min=0.3 y.max=0.6 </b> statement. The breakdown Voltage can be adjusted using the parameter
<b> AN2 </b> from the impact statement. To simulate the breakdown curve, the drain
electrode is ramped until the current reaches a specified compliance value.
</p>
<b> solve vstep=1 vfinal=30 name=drain cname=drain compliance=1 </b> <p>
The output characteristic is obtained by ramping the Gate Voltage
to the desired value and then ramping the drain voltage from 0V
to 5V. The
<b> log off </b> statement allows us to save multiple log files.
</p>
<p>
The body-drain diode behavior has also been simulated. The forward
characteristic is dependent on the drain and dource contacts
resistance as well as the epi-layer resistance. A drain contact
resistance is added using the statement
<b> contact name=drain resist=5e03</b> .
</p>
<p>
The capacitances are collected by applying a bias ramp on the
drain electrode up to 15V.  The parameter
<b> ac </b> on the solve statement sets the ac analysis on. The frequency of this
signal is set to 1MHz.
