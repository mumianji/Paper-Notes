When an IGBT is turned on in the presence of a short-circuit in an output circuit for a period of time, it can dissipate power in the form of heat to such an extent that current filaments evolve in a localized area within the IGBT device. The heating effects of current filaments are destructive and thus should not be allowed to arise during a short-circuit operation of an IGBT.
</p>
<p>
In this example, the 3D mixed-mode short-circuit simulation is performed on an IGBT composed of 8 cells to demonstrate the occurrence of current filaments in multicell IGBT.
</p>
<p>
The 8-cell IGBT structure is constructed in cell mode of Victory Process by joining 8 duplicates of the IGBT single cell together using the parameter
<b> mirror</b> on the
<b> export</b> statement. Each IGBT single cell has a width of 1um and features a 1.3 kV trench-gate design with a field-stop layer (n-buffer).
</p>
<p>
Short-circuit testing is conducted with a test circuit consisting of a
<b> vc </b> 600V DC power supply in series with a 10-mohm resistor
<b> rs </b> and a 10-nH inductor
<b> ls</b> . A
<b> vg </b> gate pulse generator in series with a 10-ohm resistor
<b> rg</b> generates a 15V pulse in 10 ns with a pulse length of 10 us.
</p>
<p>
It is assumed that the bottom collector electrode of the IGBT is maintained at an ambient temperature of 300 K via a thermal contact with a thermal resistance of 0.3 cm2.K/W (
<b> thermcontact name=collector ext.temp=300 alpha=1/0.3</b> ).
</p>
<p>
As the mixed-mode simulation starts from an initial DC voltage supply of 600V, a Victory Device solution
<b> powerex21_1.str </b> for the IGBT device
<b> adevice</b> at a collector-to-emitter voltage of 600V is first obtained from the stand-alone Victory Device simulation and then loaded into the mixed-mode part of the input deck
with
<b> .options loadsolutions </b> for use as an initial guess.
</p>
<p>
Victory Device utilizes a set of physical models for the non-isothermal (
<b> lat.temp</b> self-heating) simulation including
<b> klassen </b> low-field doping-dependent mobility ,
<b> fldmob</b> lateral electric field-dependent mobility,
<b> srh </b> Shockley-Read-Hall recombination,
<b> hnsaug</b> temperature and concentration dependence Auger recombination, and
<b> selb</b> impact ionization. The
<b> pas </b> MPI-based parallel direct solver specified in the Victory Device part of the mixed-mode input deck (
<b> method device=adevice pas</b> ) proves to greatly enhance Victor Device performance in terms of speed and robustness.
</p>
<p>
The simulation results give the short-circuit waveforms up to destruction of the IGBT at time
<b> t=5.24 us </b> as evidenced by a sharp rising of temperature in conjunction with the establishment of current filaments. A 3D electron current density distribution at that device destruction time is captured and saved for visualization in TonyPlot with
<b> .save tsave=&quot;5.24us&quot;.</b> </p>
