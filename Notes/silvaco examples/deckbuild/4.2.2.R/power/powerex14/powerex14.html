This example demonstrates modeling of a CoolMOS power device based on the paper:
</p>
<p>
P. N. Kondekar et al. &quot;Study of the Degradation of the Breakdown Voltage of a Super-Junction Power MOSFET due to Charge Imbalance&quot;,
J. Korean Phys. Soc., Vol.48, (2006) pp.624.
</p>
<p>
It shows:

 Structure definition using Athena 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Reverse Voltage Characteristics using Atlas
<br/>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
The CoolMOS is a novel power Device. In the CoolMOS device, the drift region of a conventional power
MOSFET is replaced by a superjunction (i.e. a combination on N- and P- strips in parallel). When the
device is on, the N- strip conducts the drain current. When the device is off and a drain voltage
is applied, it appears as a reverse bias between the N- and P- strips. A depletion region forms and
a relatively small value of Vd fully depletes the drift region. Subsequently the drift region behavior
is similar to that of an intrinsic region allowing higher breakdown voltage.
</p>
<p>
Once constructed, the device reverse characteristics are then simulated in Atlas (SPISCES), and the
final results are plotted showing a breakdown voltage higher than 600V.
