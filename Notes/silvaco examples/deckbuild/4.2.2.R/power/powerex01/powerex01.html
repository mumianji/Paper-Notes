This example demonstrates the reverse recovery of a silicon power diode.  It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Structure definition using Atlas 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 The SPICE-like command syntax for simulating MixedMode circuits
<br/>
   </li>
  <li>
 Steady state and transient analysis of a power diode
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The structure consists of a rectangular silicon power diode.  Atlas is used to define the power
diode structure including mesh, materials, electrodes, and doping.  The
<b> mesh rect </b> statement defines a rectangular mesh with grid lines at the locations specified by the
<b> x.m </b> and
<b> y.m </b> statements.  The entire mesh is defined as one silicon region using the
<b> region </b> statement.  Electrodes are defined on top and bottom and the
<b> doping </b> statement is used to define a uniform background concentration and gaussian n-type and p-type regions.
This structure is saved and will be used as a device by MixedMode.
</p>
<p>
In this simulation, the MixedMode circuit simulator uses Atlas to calculate the electrical characteristics of the
power diode under the specified circuit conditions.  First, a steady-state simulation of the power diode circuit
is performed.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> .begin </b> and
<b> .end </b> statements indicate the beginning and end of the MixedMode syntax.  The MixedMode commands are similar to those
used in SmartSpice.  Circuit components, topology, and analysis are defined within.
In general, the circuit component definition consists of three parts: the type of component, the lead or terminal
node assignments, and the component value or model name.  For example, the  first component definition in this
simulation is a dc voltage source.
<b> v1 </b> defines the component as voltage source number one,
<b> 1 </b> and
<b> 0 </b> are the two circuit nodes for this component, and
<b> 1000 </b> indicates that the voltage source value is 1000 volts.  The remaining circuit components are resistors
<b> r1 r2</b> , inductor
<b> l1 </b> and independent current source
<b> i1</b> . The
<b> adiode </b> statement specifies a device to be analyzed by Atlas.  The
<b> a </b> part of the adiode
command specifies that this is a device statement.  The
<b> diode </b> portion simply defines the device name.  The option
<b> infile= </b> indicates which device structure file is to be used.  The
<b> .nodeset </b> statement defines the initial values for node voltages and the
<b> .save outfile= </b> statement saves the result to the indicated file.  Since this is the steady state solution, no output log data file
is needed.  Additionally, the
<b> .options </b> command sets the solution method to a modified two-level Newton using the
<b> m2ln </b> parameter.  Other command line options exist.  Please refer to the MixedMode
section of the Atlas user&apos;s manual for a complete list.
</p>
<p>
To completely specify the simulation, the physical models used by Atlas must be specified.  The
<b> model </b> statement is used to turn on the appropriate transport models.  This set includes conmob: the concentration
dependent mobility model, fldmob: the lateral electric field-dependent mobility model, consrh: Shockley-Read-Hall
recombination using concentration dependent lifetimes, auger: recombination accounting for high level injection
effects, and bgn: band gap narrowing.
Refer to the Atlas user&apos;s manual for a description of these models.  The
<b> material </b> statement is used to override default material parameters.  In this case, the carrier recombination fixed
lifetimes are set.  Finally, an impact ionization model is enabled using the
<b> impact </b> statement with the
<b> selb </b> option.  This specifies that the Selberherr impact ionization model is to be used.
</p>
<p>
The next step is the transient analysis which is specified in a similar manner.  The reverse recovery of the diode
is simulated by dropping the value of output resistor r2 over a small increment of time.  The
<b> r2 </b> statement contains additional syntax to perform this task.  Here, the resistor is
treated as a source whose resistance decreases exponentially from 1 MOhm to 1
mOhm over the specified time step.  This action essentially shorts out the
parallel current source i1 which is also
connected to the base of the diode.  The
<b> .trans </b> statement is used to specify the time stepping parameters for the transient analysis.  In addition, the
<b> .log </b> statement saves the diode output characteristics over the time interval specified.  TonyPlot plots the transient
reverse recovery of the power diode.
