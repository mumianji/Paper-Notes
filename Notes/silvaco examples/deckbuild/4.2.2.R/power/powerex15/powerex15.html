This examples demonstrates how an SEU strike in a power MOSFET can create a
high transitory gate field sufficient to rupture the gate oxide.  Experimnets
have shown that a transitory breakdown field across the gate oxide that only
lasts for pico-second time scales, is sufficient to rupture the gate causing
permanant damage to the device.
</p>
<p>
A gate rupture event is dependent on both the device bias and the LET of the
SEU strike.  The bias that creates the most sensitive conditions for a gate
rupture event occurs when the field across the gate oxide from the gate bias
is in the same direction as the additional field from the induced charges from
the SEU event.  When this condition occurs, the existing field across the
device from the gate bias is re-enforced by the additional field created by
the SEU induced charge track, thus minimizing the LET required from the SEU
strike to cause a gate rupture event.
</p>
<p>
The example creates a power MOSFET structure using the Athena process
simulator.  Circular symmetry is then used for the device simulations, where
the center of the cylindrical device is at X=0 (the left hand side of the
structure).
</p>
<p>
An SEU strike with an LET of 37.2 (corresponding to a Bromine Ion), is
simulated, with the strike occuring at the center of the device (X=0).  At the
time of the SEU strike, a bias of -13.9 volts is applied to the gate and
30 volts on the drain.  This bias condition creates a near critical condition
close to that required for a gate rupture event to occur.
</p>
<p>
The gate oxide field was probed near the strike, such that gate oxide field
versus time could be plotted before, during and after the SEU strike.  After
the SEU strike occurs, this critical reversed bias condition results in a
peak gate oxide field that increases by over 3 times the field from just
the DC bias condition alone.
</p>
<p>
The evolution of the hole concentration distribution was also monitored
at 5, 50 and 150 pico seconds after the strike. The drain current was
simulated over a longer time span.  Just for completeness sake the breakdown
voltage and unsaturated threshold voltage (for Vd=0.1 volts) were also
simulated.
