This example demonstrates the simulation of the forward characteristics of a trench gated MOS power transistor.
Three simulations are performed to show the effect of the crystallographic plane mobility modeling on the device characteristics.
</p>
<p>
This device is created entirely within DevEdit and is composed of SiC, silicon dioxide, aluminum and polysilicon within a simulation domain of 6um x 16um.
The MOSFET has been created with a gate oxide of 800A and an N-type polysilicon gate.
</p>
<p>
The device simulations consist of the ID-VD characteristics at a gate voltage of 20V. Three characteristics were then obtained for different mobility models.
</p>
<p>
First, the standard
<b> isotropic mobility model </b> was used where the SiC mobility coefficients were defined for the
<b> &lt;1100&gt; plane </b> which is the
<b> high </b> mobility plane.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, the standard
<b> isotropic mobility model </b> was used where the SiC mobility coefficients were defined for the
<b> &lt;1000&gt; plane </b> which is the
<b> low </b> mobility plane.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, an
<b> anisotropic mobility model </b> was used where the SiC mobility coefficients were defined for
<b> both the &lt;1100&gt; and &lt;1000&gt; planes</b> .
</p>
<p>
The anisotropic model is applied by specifying a default set of mobility coefficients which apply everywhere. Then on the second
<b> mobility</b> statement the
<b> n.angle</b> parameter specifies the mobility at 90 degrees to the horizontal. This switches on the anisotropic mobility model.
