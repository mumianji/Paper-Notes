By default Victory Process and Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot;</b> could be specidied in the
<b> go</b> line starting Victory Process or Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>

This example compares the on-state IGBT mode performance of the Bi-mode Insulated Gate Transistor (BiGT) [1] with two different anode shorts stripe designs: parallel stripes
S1 and radial stripes S2. Both structures S1 and S2 have the same widths of the n+ shorts
and the p+ anode segments of 100 um and 400um, respectively.
</p>
<p>
The 3D BiGT structures are generated by Victory Process. The process simulation starts
with a 2.5um-thick anode/collector region (INIT SILICON DEPTH = 2.5) comprising an area
of 0.5mm by 4 mm  (FROM = &quot;0, 0&quot; TO = &quot;4000, 500&quot;), in which the total height of the final
structure above the anode/collector region is assumed to
be less than or equal to 200 um. A SPECIFYMASKPOLY statement defines a polygonal mask that
corresponds to each layout design, while a combination of the MASK and the DOPING
statement allows a uniform doping to be introduced directly into a particular portion of
the device volume. Thus, the desired patterns can be produced in the anode/collector
region. For ease of simulation, a 1 µm-thick heavily doped n-type layer of silicon
(DEPOSIT SILICON THICKNESS = 1 PHOSPHORUS = 1E19) is put in place of MOS cells on the
emitter side of the BiGT to render the on-state IGBT mode of the BiGT.

Victory Device performs 3D device simulations in transient mode to detect possible snapback
effects in the BiGT on-state I-V characteristics. Parallel-electric-field, inversion-layer,
temperature, and doping-dependent mobility models (CVT) as well as the Shockley-Read-Hall
(SRH) recombination model are used during 3D simulation. The collector current is ramped up
from 0 A to 30 A at a constant rate of 1 A/s, which can be done by first specifying the
current boundary condition on the collector contact with the help of the CONTACT
NAME=collector CURRENT command, and then giving a value to the ICOLLECTOR, RAMPTIME, TSTEP,
and TSTOP parameters on the SOLVE statement. With the TOL.TIME=1 parameter on the METHOD
statement, the tolerance for a local truncation error used by an adaptive time-stepping
algorithm is set to 1 instead of the default value of 5 × 10-3. Simultaneously, by means of
the NORM.SCALING.LOCAL and NEWTON parameters on the METHOD statement, the RHS norms and their
tolerances are scaled locally and the Newton solver is resorted to for transient simulations,
respectively. The ATRAP=0.1 parameter on the METHOD statement instructs Victory Device to
multiply the time-step by a factor of 0.1 once the Newton solver fails to converge. During
the transient ramp-up of collector current, the SAVE statement is repeatedly employed to
save carrier density data to structure files at various current values for visualization in
Tonyplot.

I-V curve of design S1 differs from that of design S2 in the occurrence of a number of
voltage snapbacks. Furthermore, the S1 design exhibits a higher on-state voltage drop than
the S2 design. A glance at the electron distribution in a cut plane defined along the
z-axis at z = -40 um at three different values of collector current reveals smooth transition
of the BiGT with design S2 into full conduction as a result of the spread of electrons
along the entire device length at a relatively low current. In the case of design S1, on
the contrary, electrons spread over the whole device in a step-like manner, causing th
voltage to snapback at each progressive stage of the electron spread over the p+ anode
segments.
