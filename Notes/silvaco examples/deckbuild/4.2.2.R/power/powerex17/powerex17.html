Single-crystal gallium oxide (Ga2O3) has attracted increasing attention as a promising
material for power device applications. It possesses excellent material properties and
has the potential for mass productivity of low-cost and high-quality bulk crystals by
using methods such as the edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG) method [1].
</p>
<p>
The objective of this example is to demonstrate how to simulate this new wide bandgap
oxide semiconductor material Ga2O3 and to reveal what kinds of physical models and
settings are needed in order to reproduce experimental I-V data. The experimental
data used in this benchmark were selected from a recently reported paper on the first
demonstration of Ga2O3 MOSFET [2].
</p>
<p>
The substrate is a semi-insulating single-crystal Î²-Ga2O3 and a 300 [nm] thick n-type
Ga2O3 channel layer was grown on it. The dopant concentration of the layer is
7e17 [1/cm3] and about half of this is considered to be activated. The source and drain
contact regions were formed by multiple Si implantations with 150 [nm] deep box profile
whose concentration is 5e19 [1/cm3]. We assumed that 3e19 [1/cm3] were activated. The
distance between the source and the drain box regions is 20 [um] and a 20 [nm] thick
Al2O3 gate dielectric film was formed with a 2 [um] long Ti/Pt/Au metal gate on top.
</p>
<p>
We selected simple device models as much as possible. Only the LAT.TEMP parameter was
set on the MODEL statement to solve the heat flow in the device and a constant
thermal conductivity model was used.
</p>
<p>
Simulated ID-VD curves and a ID-VG curve are shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3 with corresponding
experimental data. Fairly good agreements with experimental data were obtained using
constant mobility model even without any defect trap and interface charge
