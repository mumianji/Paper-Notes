By default Victory Process and Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot;</b> could be specified in the
<b> go</b> statement starting Victory Process or Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
This simulation is similar to the previous
<b> Buffered Superjunction LDMOS </b> but uses a low doped substrate and longer superjunctions to increase the
off state breakdown voltage to approximately 500 volts.
</p>
<p>
The structure is modelled after the one proposed by Ming Qiao et al.
in the &quot;Proceedings of the 23rd International Symposium on Power Semiconductor
Devices &amp; IC&apos;s&quot;, May 23-26, 2011 SanDiego, CA, entitled: &quot;A Noval Substrate-
Assisted
<b> RESURF </b> Technology for Small Curvature Radius Junction&quot;.
</p>
<p>
This simulation models the active region unit cell of the above device.
By careful optimization of the superjunction widths and lengths together with
the doping concentrations of these super-junctions and the related N-Well,
a 500 volt breakdown device is realized when coupled with a high resistivity
substrate.
</p>
<p>
The 3D device is then passed to Victory Device to simulate the breakdown voltage
and threshold voltage curves (IdVg)
