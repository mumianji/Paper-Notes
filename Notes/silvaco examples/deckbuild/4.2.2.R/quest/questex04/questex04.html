This example is an octagonal inductor. To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load </b> button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file, GDSII file and results to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run </b> button to execute the example.
</p>
<p>
The GDSII file can be viewed in Maskviews, Expert or any other Layout editing tool that
can read GDSII format. The process is a generic process using six metal levels and
standard values for conductivity and permittivity.
</p>
<p>
Since the inductor in this example has a diameter of approximately 300um, the depth
of the substrate in the simulation was chosen to be 400um.
</p>
<p>
A two port simulation is defined by using the reserved electrode name called
&quot;subs_ground&quot;. This grounds out the reference electrode for both the &quot;IN&quot; port and
the &quot;OUT&quot; port of the two port network.
</p>
<p>
All the results will be placed in a directory structure under the name &quot;questex04_db&quot;
which was defined with SAVE command.
</p>
<p>
Three dimensional structure files can be viewed with TonyPlot3d.  All other RLCG and
Q versus frequency data can be viewed with TonyPlot.
</p>
<p>
This example can be compared with the examples &apos;questex05&apos;, &apos;questex06&apos; and
&apos;questex07&apos; because this is the same inductor, but in the other examples a plate or a
grid is below the inductor or a pattern is around the inductor.
