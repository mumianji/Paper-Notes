This example is an octagonal inductor.  To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load </b> button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file, GDSII file and results to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run </b> button to execute the example.
</p>
<p>
The GDSII file can be viewed in MaskViews, Expert or any other Layout editing tool that can
read the GDSII format. The process is a generic process using six metal levels and
standard values for conductivity and permittivity.
</p>
<p>
Since the inductor in this example has a diameter of approximately 300um, the depth
of the substrate in the simulation was chosen to be 400um. A grid is below the
inductor.
</p>
<p>
A two port simulation is defined. The first port is between the electrodes &quot;in&quot; and
&quot;gnd1&quot;. The second port is between the electrodes &quot;out&quot; and &quot;gnd2&quot;. The reference
electrodes &quot;gnd1&quot; and &quot;gnd2&quot; are on the grid below the inductor.
</p>
<p>
All the results will be placed in a directory structure under the name &quot;questex06_db&quot;
which was defined with the SAVE command.
</p>
<p>
Three dimensional structure files can be viewed with TonyPlot3d.  All other RLCG and
Q versus frequency data can be viewed with TonyPlot.
</p>
<p>
This example can be compared with the examples &apos;questex04&apos;, &apos;questex05&apos; and &apos;questex07&apos;
because this is the same inductor, but in the other examples the inductor is alone or
a plate is below the inductor or a pattern is around the inductor.
</p>
<p>
In this example (inductor with a grid) the Qfactor is high and the
resistance is constant
since the current return path is always through the grid.
