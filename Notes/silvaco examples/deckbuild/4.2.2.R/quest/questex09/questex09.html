This example is a true curved spiral inductor. To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load </b> button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file, GDSII file and results to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run </b> button to execute the example.
</p>
<p>
The GDSII file can be viewed in MaskViews, Expert or any other layout editing tool that
can read GDSII format. The process is a generic process using six metal levels and
standard values for the conductivity and permittivity.
</p>
<p>
Since the inductor in this example has a diameter of approximately 300um, the depth
of the substrate in the simulation was chosen to be 400um. A grid is above the
inductor.
</p>
<p>
A two port simulation is defined. The first port is between the electrodes &quot;in&quot; and
&quot;gnd&quot;. The second port is between the electrodes &quot;out&quot; and &quot;gnd&quot;. The reference
electrode &quot;gnd&quot; is on the grid above the inductor.
</p>
<p>
All the results will be placed in a directory structure under the name &quot;questex09_db&quot;
which was defined with the SAVE command.
</p>
<p>
Three dimensional structure files can be viewed with TonyPlot3d. All other RLCG and Q
versus frequency data can be viewed with TonyPlot.
