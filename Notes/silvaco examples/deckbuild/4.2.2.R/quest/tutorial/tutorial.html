This example is a square inductor. The input files for all examples
are already in the software installation, and can be accessed using
the DeckBuild GUI. Start
<b> Deckbuild  </b> with the command deckbuild then from the
<b> Main Control  </b> menu select
<b> Examples. </b> Scroll down to the
<b> QUEST </b> section, double-click to expand, then double-click
on the required example. The description of the example is displayed.
To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load  </b> button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file, GDS II file and
results to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run  </b> button to execute the example.
</p>
<p>
The GDSII file can be viewed in MaskViews, Expert or any other layout editing tool that
can read GDSII format. The process is a generic process using six metal levels and
standard values for the conductivity and permittivity.
</p>
<p>
Since the inductor in this example has a diameter of approximately 400um, the depth
of the substrate in the simulation was chosen to be 400um.
</p>
<p>
A two port simulation is defined by using the reserved electrode name called
&quot;subs_ground&quot;. This grounds out the reference electrode for both the &quot;IN&quot; port and
the &quot;OUT&quot; port of the two port network.
</p>
<p>
All the results will be placed in a directory structure under the name &quot;tutorial_db&quot;
which was defined with SAVE command.
</p>
<p>
Three dimensional structure files can be viewed with TonyPlot3d.  All other RLCG and
Q versus frequency data can be viewed with TonyPlot.
