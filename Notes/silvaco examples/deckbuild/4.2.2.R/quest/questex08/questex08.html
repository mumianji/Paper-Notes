This example is 3D Interconnect with different metals on the same level.  To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load </b> button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file, GDSII file and results to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run </b> button to execute the example.
</p>
<p>
The GDSII file can be viewed in MaskViews, Expert or any other layout editing tool that
can read GDSII format.
</p>
<p>
The process is defined with multiple metals on the same level. The VIA &quot;type&quot; in the
deposit command is not used. METAL &quot;type&quot; is used instead using layers in the gds.
Use two consecutives conductor layers (to have two different conductor on the same
level) as shown below:
</p>
<p>
deposit type = &quot;metal&quot; layername = &quot;via1&quot; thick = 0.3 matName = &quot;copper&quot;
<br/>
deposit type = &quot;metal&quot; layername = &quot;via2&quot; thick = 0.3 matName = &quot;aluminum&quot;
</p>
<p>
In this example derived layers of &quot;via2&quot; were created and used to connect M1to M3
(via2_1 and via2_2 in the example).
</p>
<p>
A two port simulation is defined by using the reserved electrode name called
&quot;subs_ground&quot;. This grounds out the reference electrode for both the &quot;IN&quot; port and
the &quot;OUT&quot; port of the two port network.
</p>
<p>
All the results will be placed in a directory structure under the name &quot;questex08_db&quot;
which was defined with SAVE command.
</p>
<p>
Three dimensional structure files can be viewed with TonyPlot3d.  All other RLCG and
Q versus frequency data can be viewed with TonyPlot.
