It is based on 3 parallel lines:
<br/>
**********************************************************
<br/>
* three lines (100um) with the same conductivity. *
<br/>
<br/>
*  1st line: in1 -------- out1 width=1um *
<br/>
*                space=1um                *
<br/>
*  2nd line: in2 -------- out2 width=2um *
<br/>
*               space=0.5um              *
<br/>
*  3th line: in3 ------- out3 width=2um *

This mode is dedicated to simulating uniform transmission lines. As an output we
directly obtain files that can be simulated in a SPICE simulator.
We can use the W-elements or S-parameters produced by QUEST depending on which
simulation we want to run.
</p>
<p>
* W-elements: Used to model a coupled lossy uniform transmission line. It is
based on RLGC Matrix versus frequency. W-elements can be used for any SPICE
simulation (transient, AC...) and is a standard for major spice simulators including
SmartSpice. The File &quot;questex02_RLGC_Transient.in&quot; is an example of stimuli to study
the crosstalk between the 3 lines in a transient analysis. It directly loads the
&quot;questex02_welement.sp&quot; file produced by quest. These files must be in the same directory.
</p>
<p>
* S-parameter:  Matrix of S-parameters (and Y and Z) versus frequency. It can be
directly analyzed or used as input for other simulators (SPICE, RF simulator) for
AC analysis. QUEST produces all the intermediary files to include them directly into
SmartSpice. The File &quot;questex02_S_devices.in&quot; is an example of stimuli for
SmartSpice to study the crosstalk between the 3 lines with an AC simulation.
It shows that this phenomena is more important on high frequencies. It directly
loads the &quot;questex02_s_param.mod&quot; and &quot;questex02_s_param.par&quot;
produced by quest. These files must be in the same directory.
