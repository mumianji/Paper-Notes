This example demonstrates the use of an Expert LISA script used by QUEST to generate
a parameterized gds layout.
</p>
<p>
Introduction:
</p>
<p>
In order to build an inductance model or make a variation of layout parameters it
is especially interesting to have parametrized gds. This is possible in QUEST
using Expert&apos;s LISA scripting language.
</p>
<p>
Running the Example
</p>
<p>
To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load</b> button in DeckBuild &gt; Examples. This will copy the input file and any support files to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run</b> button in DeckBuild to execute the example.
</p>
<p>
In this example, four layout variables are defined (number of coils, radius,wire_width
and space) and the layout is created accordingly using the creategds command in
QUEST associated with the EXPERT script file.
</p>
<p>
Results analysis
</p>
<p>
Inductor performance is monitored using the extract capability of DeckBuild.
</p>
<p>
This example shows how to use the
<b> DBinternal </b> capability to investigate the geometrical layout variation on the inductor
performance. Please refer to the DeckBuild example DOE: Design of Experiment Examples
for detailed explanation of the
<b> DBinternal </b> syntax and the DeckBuild manual.
</p>
<p>
When loaded in SPAYN (start SPAYN and load inductor.db) a quadratic model of L as a
function of 3 layout variables can be done. For that in SPAYN go to tool
regression and select L as target and NB_COILS, WIRE_WIDTH and RADIUS as predictors.
Perform a quadratic model with interaction and click on TonyPlot. You thus have a
Response Surface Model (RSM) that you can use for synthesis for example.
