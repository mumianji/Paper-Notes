This example is based on Questex04.
</p>
<p>
To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load</b> button in DeckBuild &gt; Examples. This will copy the input file and any support files to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run</b> button in DeckBuild to execute the example.

<p>
The GDSII file can be viewed in MaskViews, Expert or any other layout editing tool that
can read GDSII format.

You can compare the results of the inductor parameter (Q factor) according to
the substrate properties and permittivities. The files questex17_losstangent.txt and
questex17_permittivity.txt, where losstangent and permittivity are defined versus
frequency, are loaded using the parameters
<b> permit.file </b> and
<b> loss.file </b> in the material statement. The frequency range used during QUEST simulation
should match the frequency used to define questex17_losstangent.txt and
questex17_permittivity.txt files. For that, use the
<b> list </b> parameter on the frequency statement.

<p>
A two port simulation is defined by using the reserved electrode name called
&quot;subs_ground&quot;. This grounds out the reference electrode for both the &quot;in&quot; port and
the &quot;out&quot; port of the two port network.
</p>
<p>
All the results will be placed in a directory structure under the name &quot;questex17_db&quot;
which was defined with SAVE command.
</p>
<p>
Three dimensional structure files can be viewed with TonyPlot3d. All other RLCG and Q
versus frequency data can be viewed with TonyPlot.
