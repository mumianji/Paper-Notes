This example is based on a National University of Singapore paper by Wen-Yan Yin and
al. &quot;Model Description and Parameter Extraction of On-Chip Spiral Inductors for MMICs&quot;
International Journal on RF and Microwave CAE 14 pp.111-121 2004. It presents a
statistical description of the global performance of on-chip spiral inductors based
on extensive measurement.

To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load</b> button in DeckBuild &gt; Examples. This will copy the input file and any support files to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run</b> button in DeckBuild to execute the example.
</p>
<p>
The GDSII file can be viewed in MaskViews, Expert or any other layout editing tool that
can read GDSII format. The process file was also created using information from the
paper.
</p>
<p>
You can  compare the results of the inductor parameters (RLGC / Q factor)
according to the substrate properties.
</p>
<p>
A two port simulation is defined by using the reserved electrode name called
&quot;subs_ground&quot;. This grounds out the reference electrode for both the &quot;in&quot; port and
the &quot;out&quot; port of the two port network.
</p>
<p>
All the results will be placed in a directory structure under the name &quot;questex10_db&quot;
which was defined with the SAVE command.
</p>
<p>
Three dimensional structure files can be viewed with TonyPlot3d. All other RLCG and Q
versus frequency data can be viewed with TonyPlot.
