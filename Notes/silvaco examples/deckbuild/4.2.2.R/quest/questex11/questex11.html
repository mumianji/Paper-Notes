This example demonstrates the advantages of straight line inductors.
</p>
<p>
Introduction:
</p>
<p>
It is often perceived that the highest inductance and Q factor are obtained using
spiral inductors. This, however, is only true if the inductor has more than
approximately 1.5 turns. Designers will often design 1 turn or 1.25 turn inductors
out of habit, not realizing that a significantly better performing inductor can be
designed with a straight line inductor.
</p>
<p>
The reason a straight inductor outperforms a one turn inductor in terms of
inductance per length and Q factor is two fold:
</p>
<p>
1) If an inductor only has one turn, there is no added inductance from the mutual
inductance of the other coils as occurs in a multi-turn inductor.
</p>
<p>
2) In a one turn inductor, inductance is lost due to the current travelling in
opposite directions in the opposite conductor which is not mitigated by mutual
inductance from other windings.
</p>
<p>
In a straight line inductor, there is also no mutual inductance benefit, BUT there
is also no inductance lost due to opposite conductors having current flowing in
opposite directions, because there are no opposite conductors in a straight line.
</p>
<p>
Experiment Description:
</p>
<p>
In this Quest experiment, two inductor layouts are compared:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 The first layout is a straight line inductor 480um long and 10um wide.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
 The second inductor has an identical length and width but is as a one turn 
design.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Results:
</p>
<p>
The results show that not only does the straight line inductor exhibit a greater
inductance than its one turn counter part, but the maximum Q factor is also
significantly higher.

Running the Example
</p>
<p>
To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load</b> button in DeckBuild &gt; Examples. This will copy the input file and any support files to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run</b> button in DeckBuild to execute the example.
</p>
<p>
questex11_command.in is the quest input file common to the line and one turn inductor gds.
Two simulations will thus be run one after the other.
