{subsection} radex04.in : Arbitrary Charge Generation using C-Interpreter 

Requires: Device 3D/C-Interpreter
{newline}
Minimum Versions: Atlas 5.20.2.R

This examples demonstrates the use of the C interpreter function
{bold} F3.RADIATE.  
This function allows the user to specify arbitrary
electron hole pair generation as a function of position and time.
This example illustrates the functionality using a simple block 
function for the charge. Other template files are loaded along
with the input file. These can be substituted in the line:

{bold} beam num=1 f3.radiate=(filename)

{bold} Note 
that a generation value calculated by the C function for each XYZ
location in the device. This value is multiplied by the value of the
{bold} b1 
of the 
{bold} solve 
statement before being applied.

To load and run this example, select the
{bold} Load example 
button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file and any support
files to your current working directory. Select the
{bold} run 
button to execute the example.
