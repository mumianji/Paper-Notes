This examples demonstrates SEU simulation in a reversed biased three
dimensional diode.
</p>
<p>
In this example, a diode structure is constructed using DevEdit 3D. The
structure is then passed to Atlas. The input file consists of the following
parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the 3D device in DevEdit 3D
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Transfer of the structure to Atlas by the DeckBuild autointerface feature
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting of the physical models 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Perform DC bias solution 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of parameters for the charge track
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of the effects of SEU
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first stage of the input constructs the diode geometry, material regions,
doping profiles, and electrodes in DevEdit 3D. The structure was created in
DevEdit 3D by drawing the device regions in interactive mode and specifying 3D
doping distribution. Finally, the mesh was generated automatically by specifying
basic mesh constraints and refining in the important areas of the device.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas simulation begins by reading the structure from DevEdit 3D.
DeckBuild provides autointerface between DevEdit 3D and Atlas so that the
structure produced by DevEdit 3D is transferred to Atlas without having to
indicate the mesh statement.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> models </b> statement is used to select a set of physical models for this simulation.
In this case, these models are SRH recombination, bandgap narrowing,
concentration and field dependent mobility model.
</p>
<p>
After the initial solution, the emitter voltage is ramped up to 3V in
DC mode,  thereby giving the initial condition of the structure for
transient analysis. The Newton algorithm is used for these
calculations.
</p>
<p>
The key syntax in any SEU simulation is the
<b> singleeventupset </b> statement, which is used to specify entry and exit points, radius and density
of the electron-hole pair distribution generated by the particle track.
</p>
<p>
Transient analysis is then performed to simulate charge
collection in the device due to the SEU. The
<b> method halfimpl </b> statement indicates that the half implicit scheme is to be used in the transient
simulation. In this scheme the Poisson&apos;s, two continuity, and the total
current equations are solved in sequence. This method ensures efficient and fast convergence in transient mode.
</p>
<p>
The results of the simulation are saved in the log file and then displayed using TonyPlot.
