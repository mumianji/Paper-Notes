{subsection} radex14.in : TCAD to SPICE - 6T SRAM SEU Simulation

Requires: Deckbuild/VictoryProcess2D/DevEdit 3D/VictoryDevice3D/SmartSpice
{newline}
Minimum Versions: Deckbuild 4.4.1.R / VictoryProcess 7.14.3.R / 
Devedit 2.8.26.R / VictoryDevice 1.10.2.R / SmartSpice 4.26.10.R

This examples demonstrates how the response of a single transistor to a Single
Event Strike, can first be simulated and calibrated using physics based TCAD 
simulation, and then how this exact response can be extracted into a data file
and incorporated directly into user specified circuit nodes of a Spice circuit 
simulation, for fast Spice analysis of a circuit to Single Event Upsets.

The example demonstrates how this entire TCAD to SPICE flow can be simulated
with just a single input file, executed in it's entirety in the deckbuild run 
time environment, without any intermediate input required from the user.

The example simulates the response of a single 65nm n-channel MOSFET to a 
Single Event Strike using physically based TCAD simulation.  The terminal
response from this TCAD simulation, is then captured in a data file.  This 
MOSFET response to the Single Event Strike can then be passed to a 100% 
SmartSPICE simulation to evaluate the whole circuit response to a strike.
Since the simulation is now 100% Spice, the total circuit simulation time of a
Single Event Strike is just a few seconds for a logic cell sized circuit.  This
allows many simulations of multiple Single Events, occurring in any transistor
in any circuit, occurring at any time, once the response to a particular strike
has been calibrated using physics based TCAD.

The data flow in this particular example occurs in the following sequence:

{bullet} Start with a trusted Spice model from the foundry PDK that you are 
               currently using.
{newline}
{bullet}Using this PDK Spice model, simulate basic DC characteristics of the
               device type that is to be tested using a Single Event Strike, 
               such as unsaturated and saturated threshold voltage, IdVd curve
               sets etc.
{newline}
{bullet} Create a TCAD model of the device to be tested, and use the Spice 
               generated DC characteristics above, to ensure that the TCAD 
               simulations are a reasonable match to the Spice generated curves.
{newline}
{bullet} In TCAD, then simulate one or more strike events and capture the 
               device response by extracting a data file of time/current pairs.
{newline}
{bullet} The time/current pairs data file captured above, is then loaded into a
               pure Spice simulation as a time dependent current source at the
               circuit node under test, so the response of the whole circuit to 
               a Single Event Strike can now be simulated directly in Spice. 
               Multiple strikes at different times on different devices in the
               circuit can also be simulated using the same data file.
{newline}

With the data flow above in mind, the input file below goes through the
following simulation steps:

First, a two dimensional, 65nm nMOS device is simulated in VictoryProcess,
which enables a faster simulation than creating a full 3D structure.  The 2D 
structure is then extended into the third dimension using Devedit.  The 3D 
structure is now loaded into VictoryDevice, where several DC simulations, 
characterise the basic device electrical behaviour, which can then be compared
with the Spice model, to validate that similar behaviour has been obtained.

The energy of the Single Event Strike is characterized by a parameter called 
the 
{bold}"Linear Energy Transfer",
 or 
{bold}LET.  
The higher the LET, the greater the energy of the incoming particle or photon.
In this example, the LET value of the incoming strike is set up as a variable, 
by the line 
{bold}"set LET=1",
which creates a variable called 
{bold}"$LET"
and assigns it a unity value.  In order to convert the units of LET into units 
of pico Coulombs/cm3 of track charge density, the 
{bold}LET value needs to be multiplied by 0.01035 for silicon material.
A second variable called 
{bold}"$density" 
is assigned this converted pico coulomb value.  Lastly, the units of the strike
are specified to be these same pico coulomb units, by the parameter 
{bold}"pcunits" 
in the 
{bold}"singleeventupset" 
statement that describes the time and track positional properties of the strike.

Once the Single Event Strike has been simulated, the time versus current data
is extracted using an extract statement, into a file called 
{bold}radex14.dat.  
An important part of this extract statement is the 
{bold}new "no.header" option, 
which strips off the normal header associated with a standard Silvaco data 
file format, which is a requirement for the data file to be read directly by 
SmartSpice.

Simulation of a 6 transistor SRAM cell, with a Single Event Strike on one of 
the nMOS transistors, can now be simulated directly in SmartSpice using the
newly creted data file.  The strike can also be associated with a time delay
before the strike occurs.  This delay is implemented in the 
{bold}"VSEU" 
line of the SmartSpice section of the input file, and is specified using the 
{bold}"TD" 
parameter.  In this simulation, the delay before the Single Event Strike is set
to be 0.5 micro-seconds by setting the parameter 
{bold}"TD=0.5u" 
on the 
{bold}"VSEU" 
statement.  

The huge advantage of importing the TCAD generated data file of the Single
Event Strike, directly into Spice, is that each Spice simulation, now only 
takes a couple of seconds, so many strikes at different times and for different
transistors, allows fast characterization of a circuit sensitivity to SEU upset
events.
