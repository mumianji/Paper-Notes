This examples demonstrates the simulation of proton irradiation damage in a
2N2222 bipolar transistor.
</p>
<p>
The 2N2222 bipolar transistor is one of the most common devices found in
satellites, and is a standard benchmark for devices to be tested against.
There are numerous manufacturers of this part number.  In this example,
specifications were taken from an example made by ON Semiconductor.  The ON
semiconductor device exhibits a base/emitter breakdown voltage of 6 Volts and a
collector/base breakdown voltage of 70 Volts.  The floating base
collector/emitter breakdown voltage is 40 Volts.  The minimum gain was
specified at 100 when Vce=10 Volts.
</p>
<p>
Not shown in this example, the base doing was simulated such that Veb=6 Volts
with solid solubility doping in the emitter.  Once this base doping was known,
the colletor doping was set such that Vcb&gt;70 Volts with the previously
extracted base doping.  The base width was set such that the current gain was
greater than 100 consistent with a floating base Vce&gt;40 Volts.
</p>
<p>
Once the DC characteristics were satisfactory, proton irradiation was simulated
with a proton fluence of 1e11, 1e12 and 1e13/cm2, as set in the
<b> radiation</b> statement using the
<b> flence</b> parameter.  The physical damage created by the proton irradiation is caused by
the
<b> Non Ionising Energy Loss (neil)</b> parameter, since it is presumed that the ionising part of the energy loss
mechanism occurs by elastic scattering, and therefore creates no damage.
Also set is the scaling factor parameter
<b> dam.proton</b> and the energy of the in-coming protons.
</p>
<p>
For each fluence simulation, the simulator creates bulk defects in proportion
to the specified fluence, whose capture cross sections are specified in the
<b> defects</b> statement, together with the
<b> fluence.model</b> switch parameter.  The other defects statement in the input file is there
because in this example, we are using a polysilicon emitter doping source, so a
further defect statement is required to specify the defects in the polysilicon
which obviously existed prior to irradiation.
