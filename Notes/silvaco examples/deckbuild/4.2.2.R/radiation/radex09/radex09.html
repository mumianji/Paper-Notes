This examples demonstrates Single Event Burnout (SEB) in a High Voltage PiN Diode
</p>
<p>
The structure of the 3D PiN diode is simple enough to be emulated directly in
the device simulator without the need to resort to a full process simulator.
Further simplification is afforded by the
<b> circular symmetry </b> of the diode allowing the diode to be simulated in two dimensions with
cylindrical corrections to correctly predict 3D device characteristics.  For
the simulation of single events, only a central and vertical strike is a valid
candidate for correctly simulating 3D effects using this 2 dimensional circular
symetry method.  This method is invoked using the
<b> cylindrical</b> parameter, on the mesh statement
</p>
<p>
There are two important requirements for simulating Single Event Burnout (SEB).
Firstly, the device IV characteristics must display a
<b> &quot;snapback&quot;</b> characteristic, where, for at least a range of voltages, there exists two
possible corresponding stable current conditions, one a low current &quot;off&quot; state
and a second high current &quot;on&quot; state.  At high voltages, the &quot;on&quot; state
dissipates sufficient power to over heat the device.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, self heating plays a leading role in greatly reducing the current
density in a PiN diode at which the snapback IV characteristic occurs, allowing
a significantly lower
<b> Linear Energy Transfer (LET)</b> strike to transfer the diode from an &quot;off&quot; state, to a stable &quot;on&quot; state, where
continuous heating eventually burns the device to destruction, hence the name
of the phenomenon, &quot;Single Event Burnout&quot;.
</p>
<p>
This example, first biases the PiN diode close to it&apos;s breakdown voltage of
<b> 3,500 volts.</b> Then a
<b> LOOP, L.END</b> statement is used to start the simulation with a strike of 4 MeV-cm2/mg LET.
The LOOP then doubles the LET strike value until the current pulse from the
strike is sufficient to transfer the IV characteristics to a stable &quot;on&quot; state,
whereupon the device burns out in short order afterwards.
