This examples demonstrates High Dose Rate Effects and uses MixedMode to
Demonstrate Operation of a Radiation Detector Circuit.  The active device used
as the radiation detector is a PiN diode incorporating a field reducing edge
termination contact which is created in Victory Process in 2D mode.  The PiN
diode exhibits
<b> circular symmetry, </b> so full 3D effects can be simulated using a 2D structure with cylindrical
symmetry corrections.
</p>
<p>
Once the PiN diode was created, the structure is loaded into the device
simulator, and  SPICE circuit is included using
<b> MIXEDMODE</b> syntax.  Two greatly differing prompt dose rates of 1e8 and 1e12 Rads/second
were simulated to test the versitility of the radiation detector circuit.  The
timing of the radiation bursts is determined by the
<b> .RAD</b> statement in the MixedMode SPICE like syntax.
</p>
<p>
It is found that the radiation detector circuit gives a consistent detection
output pulse for these two widely differing does rates and therefore total
doses, validating the circuit design.
