{subsection} radex13.in : High Dose Rate Radiation Detector Circuit

Requires: VictoryProcess/VictoryDevice/MixedMode/REM
{newline}
Minimum Versions: Victory Process 7.14.3.R, Victory Mesh 1.0.4.R, Victory Device 1.10.2.R

This examples demonstrates High Dose Rate Effects and uses MixedMode to 
Demonstrate Operation of a Radiation Detector Circuit.  The active device used
as the radiation detector is a PiN diode incorporating a field reducing edge 
termination contact which is created in VictoryProcess in 2D mode.  The PiN 
diode exhibits
{bold} circular symmetry, 
so full 3D effects can be simulated using a 2D structure with cylindrical 
symmetry corrections.

Once the PiN diode was created, the structure is loaded into the device 
simulator, and  SPICE circuit is included using
{bold} MIXEDMODE
syntax.  Two greatly differing prompt dose rates of 1e8 and 1e12 Rads/second
were simulated to test the versitility of the radiation detector circuit.  The
timing of the radiation bursts is determined by the
{bold} .RAD
statement in the MixedMode SPICE like syntax.

It is found that the radiation detector circuit gives a consistent detection 
output pulse for these two widely differing does rates and therefore total 
doses, validating the circuit design.
