{subsection} radex05.in : Defining a Sphere of Charge using C-Interpreter

Requires: Device 3D/Luminous 3D/C-Interpreter
{newline}
Minimum Versions: Atlas 5.20.2.R

This examples demonstrates the f3.radiate function by generating a 
sphere of charge inside a cube of semiconductor material.


Note that a generation value calculated by the C function for each XYZ
location in the device. This value is multiplied by the value of the
{bold} b1 
of the 
{bold} solve 
statement before being applied.

To load and run this example, select the
{bold} Load example 
button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file and any support
files to your current working directory. Select the
{bold} run 
button to execute the example.
