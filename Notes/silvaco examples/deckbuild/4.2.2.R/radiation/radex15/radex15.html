This example is a variant of radex14, where instead of using pure Spice to
simulate an SEU strike on a 65nm SRAM cell, the SEU simulation section uses
MixedMode3D instead.
</p>
<p>
The Mixedmode3D simulation uses the same 65nm nMOS TACD structure that was
calibrated against a PDK Spice model in radex14, and wraps the rest of the SRAM
circuit around this TCAD structure using Mixedmode3D&apos;s Spice syntax.
The TCAD structure is struck with a 1 LET single event when it is in it&apos;s low
power configuration with an applied supply voltage of 0.85 volts, which
represents the state of highest sensitivity to being upset by a single event.
</p>
<p>
The data flow in this particular example occurs in the following sequence:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 The calibrated 65nm nMOS TCAD structure is the same one used in 
the previous radex14 example
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 The 65nm nMOS TCAD only structure is biased into it&apos;s high sensitivity,
low power off state, with Vd=0.85 Volts and Vs,Vg=0 Volts.
This TCAD only structure, in this biased state, is then saved.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 A new device simulation, this time in MixedMode3D, which contains the
rest of the SRAM circuit, is then specified, and the previously
saved biased TCAD structure is loaded, and it&apos;s biased condition
initializes the circuit state.  The line which loads the TCAD
structure intial state is:
<b> .OPTIONS loadsolutions</b> <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 After the MixedMode3D simulation is complete, the solutions are 
plotted at the end.
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The energy of the Single Event Strike is characterized by a parameter called
the
<b> &quot;Linear Energy Transfer&quot;,</b> or
<b> LET.  </b> The higher the LET, the greater the energy of the incoming particle or photon.
In this example, the LET value of the incoming strike is set up as a variable,
by the line
<b> &quot;set LET=1&quot;,</b> which creates a variable called
<b> &quot;$LET&quot;</b> and assigns it a unity value.  In order to convert the units of LET into units
of pico Coulombs/um of track charge density, the
<b> LET value needs to be multiplied by 0.01035 for silicon material.</b> A second variable called
<b> &quot;$density&quot; </b> is assigned this converted pico coulomb value.  Lastly, the units of the strike
are specified to be these same pico coulomb units, by the parameter
<b> &quot;pcunits&quot; </b> in the
<b> &quot;singleeventupset&quot; </b> statement that describes the time and track positional properties of the strike.
