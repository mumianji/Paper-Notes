This examples demonstrates Multiple Strike SEU Simulation in a 6 Transistor
22nm SRAM Cell.
</p>
<p>
Victory Process in Cell Mode is used to create the 6 transistor SRAM cell
structure.  The 4 layers of metal interconnect are left off in this example in
an effort to speed up the device simulation.  A mixture of mask features and
traditional &quot;line&quot; statements are used to create the structure mesh.  Monte-
Carlo implant is used extensively in the process flow, so the process
simulation run time can be greatly reduced by taking advantage of the mult-
threaded option on the &quot;go victoryprocess&quot; line.
</p>
<p>
In the device simulation, a large number of &quot;contact&quot; statements are required
to connect the various parts of the circuit, that would have been connected by
the 4 layers of interconnect, that were omitted from the original design, in
the interests of device simulation speed.  Also of note is the
<b> &quot;seu.integrate&quot;</b> parameter in the method statement that ensures correct total charge integration
in the SEU charge track, reducing still further the required mesh count in the
vicinity of the strike locations.
</p>
<p>
The device simulation hits the nMOS devices in the main Flip-Flop of the SRAM
with SEU strikes, staggered in time to allow for circuit recovery before the
next strike.  Striking each nMOS device in turn ensures that at least one of
the strikes will occur to an nMOS device in an &quot;off state&quot; ensuring that the
SRAM will change state at least once as a result of the strikes.
