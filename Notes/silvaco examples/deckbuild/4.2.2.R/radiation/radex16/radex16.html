This example is a variant of radex14, where instead simulating the drain
current response from an SEU strike using TCAD, and then importing this SEU data
into a SmartSpice simulation, here we use an internal SmartSpice algorithm to
calculate the total track charge created by the strike which is then converted
into current time pairs internally at a specified device node and time.
</p>
<p>
The obvious advantage of using Spice to calculate the SEU track charge versus
time, instead of using TCAD, is simulation speed.  The downside is that the
calculation is a worst case calculation, since it is assumed that all of the
generated charge is actually collected by the device node, which is not usually
the case.  In reality, the actual fraction of charge collected depends on
strike angle and strike location and whether any carrier multiplication occurs
from high electric fields and internal gain etc.
</p>
<p>
The SEU event is struck at the same nMOS drain node, in the same SRAM circuit
as in radex14 example, and with the same Linear Energy Transfer value of unity,
which is now set in the
<b> .PARAM DLET=1</b> statement.  The total charge in the charge track is calculated by integrating
over the SEU track length, which is set by the
<b> .PARAM F_LENGTH=0.5u</b> statement.  Other timing parameters are also set on .PARAM statement lines.
</p>
<p>
For simulation method comparisons, the SRAM operation point is set to it&apos;s low
power configuration with an applied supply voltage of 0.85 volts, which
represents the state of highest sensitivity to being upset by a single event.
