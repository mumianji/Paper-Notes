This examples demonstrates Single Event gate Rupture (SEGR) in a Power MOSFET
</p>
<p>
The structure of the 3D Power MOSFET in this example is conveniently
cylindrically symmetric allowing the 3D structure to be simulated accurately
using only two dimensions with cylindrical co-ordinates.  For the simulation of
single events, only a central and vertical strike is a valid candidate for
correctly simulating 3D effects using this 2 dimensional circular symetry
method.  This method is invoked using the
<b> cylindrical</b> parameter, on the mesh statement.
</p>
<p>
After the 2 dimensional Victory Process simulation of the power MOSFET, the
structure was exported to
<b> Devedit </b> to create a mesh suitable for device simulation.
</p>
<p>
In the device simulator, the power MOSFET is biased to a condition where the
drain voltage is approximately twice the gate voltage, which is known to
make such a device more susceptible to gate rupture after a single event.
</p>
<p>
A single event, with an LET value of 37.2 MeV-cm2/mg corresponding to a bromine
ion, was allowed to strike the power MOSFET and the evolution of the gate oxide
electric field was monitored using the
<b> probe</b> statement.  It is observed that the gate oxide electric field suffered a 3 fold
increase, just after the strike, taking it close to the bulk dielectric
breakdown field strength and therefore vulnerable to an irreversible di-
electric breakdown event.  The gate oxide Fowler Nordheim current was also
monitored and exceeded one tenth of a nano Amp.
