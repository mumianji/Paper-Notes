This examples demonstrates Single Event gate Rupture (SEGR) in a Power MOSFET

The structure of the 3D Power MOSFET in this example is conveniently 
cylindrically symmetric allowing the 3D structure to be simulated accurately
using only two dimensions with cylindrical co-ordinates.  For the simulation of
single events, only a central and vertical strike is a valid candidate for 
correctly simulating 3D effects using this 2 dimensional circular symetry 
method.  This method is invoked using the
{bold} cylindrical
parameter, on the mesh statement.

After the 2 dimensional VictoryProcess simulation of the power MOSFET, the 
structure was exported to
{bold} Devedit 
to create a mesh suitable for device simulation.

In the device simulator, the power MOSFET is biased to a condition where the
drain voltage is approximately twice the gate voltage, which is known to 
make such a device more susceptible to gate rupture after a single event.

A single event, with an LET value of 37.2 MeV-cm2/mg corresponding to a bromine
ion, was allowed to strike the power MOSFET and the evolution of the gate oxide
electric field was monitored using the
{bold} probe
statement.  It is observed that the gate oxide electric field suffered a 3 fold
increase, just after the strike, taking it close to the bulk dielectric 
breakdown field strength and therefore vulnerable to an irreversible di-
electric breakdown event.  The gate oxide Fowler Nordheim current was also
monitored and exceeded one tenth of a nano Amp.
