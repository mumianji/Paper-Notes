This examples demonstrates Inter Device Leakage from XRay Total Dose Exposure
</p>
<p>
For older technologies, one of the main effects of
<b> Total Dose Irradiation</b> was the accumulation of positive charge in the gate oxide, resulting in
threshold voltage shifts that either reduced current drive or increased off
state leakage, depending on whether the device was a p- or n-MOS device
respectively.  For more agressive technologies, the gate oxides are so thin,
that the major effect of Total Dose Irradiation is the trapping of positive
charge in the trench isolation oxides, creating a parasitic current leakage
path between trench isolated devices.  The leakage path could be between the
Source/Drain contacts of two seperate nMOS devices, or could be between the
Source/Drain contact of an nMOS device and the n-Well isolation of a p-MOS
device.  In this example, we demonstrate the creation of a current leakage path
between two nMOS devices.  Leakage betwen an nMOS and pMOS n-Well is
essentially the same phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
Victory Process is used to create the two nMOS devices, seperated and
electrically isolated by a trench and p-well with associated trench implants.
</p>
<p>
There are several basic input file set up requirements for simulating total
dose effects in Victory Device:
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 the effected insulators must be simulated as wide bandgap semiconductors
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 any doping in the insulator therefore needs to be removed
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 insulator trap densities, characteristics and locations need to be defined
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 the radiation source and dose rate needs to be defined 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 the parameter &quot;radiation&quot; needs to be invoked on the solve statement
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
To convert an insulator to a wide bandgap semiconductor, the material statement
is used.  For example:
<br/>
<b> material material=oxide semiconductor</b> <br/>
</p>
<p>
To remove any existing doping from the insulator, which would cause erroneous
conduction, the &quot;doping replace&quot; syntax is used.  For example:
<br/>
<b> doping material=oxide replace uniform net concentration=-1</b> <br/>
</p>
<p>
Two types of insulator traps can be defined, bulk insulator traps, using the
<b> oxidecharging</b> statement and interface insulator traps, using the
<b> intoxidecharging</b> statement in a direct analagy to defect and intdefect statements.  Two model
implementations are also available, the
<b> &quot;Jmodel&quot; </b> and the
<b> &quot;Vmodel&quot;.</b> The user is directed to the manual to gain a full understanding of the meaning
of all the parameters in these statements and the model implementation, as a
full description is too lengthy for this brief example description.
</p>
<p>
The radiation source and dose rate are defined in the radiation statement.
Here a 10keV XRay source and a dose rate of 1 Rad per second is defined, using
the radiation statement:
<b> radiation doserate=1 XRay</b> </p>
<p>
The convenience of defining a dose rate of 1 Rad per second is that the total
dose will be the same as the elapsed transient time in the solve statement, if
the parameter &quot;radiation&quot; was invoked in the transient from the start.
</p>
<p>
The simulation shows how the leakage between the two trench isolated nMOS
devices, increases after a total dose of 3 MRads.
