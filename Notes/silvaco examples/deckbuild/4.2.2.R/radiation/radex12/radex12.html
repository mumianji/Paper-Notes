This examples demonstrates Proton Irradiation Damage in a CMOS Image Sensor
</p>
<p>
This example uses Victory Process Cell mode to create a CMOS image sensor (CIS)
complete with two pass transistors.  The image sensor was then irradiated with
a damaging fluence of protons in several stages, and the damage effects on the
performance of the image sensor were monitored.
</p>
<p>
In order to speed up the process simulation, initially 1D Monte-Carlo implant
simulations were stored as data files and imported into Victory Process Cell
mode using the
<b> Profile</b> statement.  Other implants used the 3D Monte-Carlo BCA simulator in the normal
way.
</p>
<p>
During Device simulations, the level of electron depletion in the active
section of the image sensor was monitored using the
<b> Probe n.conc</b> statement.  Electrostatic potentials were also monitored using this method.
</p>
<p>
The image sensor was pulsed into deep electron depletion, and then monitored
with time, to see how long it took for thermal generation to re-fill the active
region of the image sensor.   The longer the time for thermal generation to
refill the depleted active region, the more versitile the image sensor will be.
</p>
<p>
Once a baseline time was established for the un-damaged image sensor, the
sensor was subject to proton fluxes of 1e10, 1e11 and 1e12 proton/cm2 and the
dark recovery time was re-tested to observe the effects of the proton induced
damage.  In this example, rather than use LOOP statements, the internal
<b> Design of Experiments (DoE)</b> feature of deckbuild was used, using the
<b> sweep</b> parameter to define the levels of proton irradiation per cm2.  It was found
that the damage was slight but noticable for a flux of 1e10 protons/cm2 but the
final proton flux of 1e12/cm2 was sufficient to render the image sensor non
operational.  When viewing the electrical results, it must be bourne in mind
that the proton damage also damages the pass transistors, which effects the
whole operation of the sensor.
</p>
<p>
The proton flux is set up using the
<b> radiation proton energy=1.8 fluence=&lt;p/cm2&gt;</b> statement, with the total fluence being the variable in the Design of
Experiments.  The damage rate and non ionizing energy loss are set on the
<b> material dam.proton=1e3 dam.niel=3.1</b> statement.  The capture cross sections for the proton damage created defects is
set using the
<b> defects fluence.model</b> statement.
