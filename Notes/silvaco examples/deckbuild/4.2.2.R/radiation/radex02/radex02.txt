{subsection} radex02.in : Multiple Ion Tracks

Requires: DevEdit 3D/Device 3D
{newline}
Minimum Versions: Atlas 5.20.2.R

This examples demonstrates SEU simulation in a diode structure in three
dimensions initiated by multiple tracks. Time dependence of the carrier
generation  is also included in the specification of the second
particle track. The input file consists of the following parts:

{bullet} Construction of the 3D device in DevEdit 3D
{newline}
{bullet} Transfer of the structure to Atlas by DeckBuild autointerface feature
{newline}
{bullet} Physical models specification
{newline}
{bullet} SEU parameter specification
{newline}
{bullet} Simulation of the effects of SEU

The diode structure under consideration is the same as in the previous
example and is constructed with the same DevEdit 3D run. The structure is
then passed to Atlas for electrical calculations using the
autointerface feature in DevEdit 3D. The same set of physical models
is applied.

The two
{bold} singleeventupset 
statements are now used to specify entry and exit points, radius and
density of generated electron-hole pairs due to  two alpha particle
tracks. Different from the first track where the generation rate is
position dependent, only the second track includes position and time
dependent generation. Parameters tc and t0 in the second statement
specify the characteristic time of the Gaussian time dependency, and
the time instant of the peak of generation.

The emitter voltage is ramped here again up to 3V in the DC mode, and then the transient analysis is performed to simulate charge collection in the device.
The numerical algorithms that are used repeat those of the previous example.

The results of the simulation are saved in the log file and then displayed using TonyPlot.

To load and run this example, select the
{bold} Load example 
button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file and any support
files to your current working directory. Select the
{bold} run 
button to execute the example.
