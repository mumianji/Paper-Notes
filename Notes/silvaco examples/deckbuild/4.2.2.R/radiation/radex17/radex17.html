A common issue for any CMOS circuit is the existance of a parasitic thyristor
resulting from the NPNP structure that exists between any complementary pair
source/drain contacts.  The four regions creating the NPNP thyristor, are the
N-channel drain, N-channel Well, P-channed well, and P-channel drain
respectively.
</p>
<p>
In order for the parasitic thyristor to trigger, the NPN and PNP transistors,
making up the parasitic thyristor, must have a multiplied bipolar gain of at
least unity at the operating condition of the circuit.  Negating the triggering
of this parasitic thyristor is simply a matter of ensuring that this condition
almost never happens.  There are two main ways to do this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Reduce the bipolar gain of the parasitic bipolars by heavily doping the
respective base regions (the N and Pwell regions)  This is most often
done by doping the bottom of the trench.  Careful consideration of
where this doping is placed is required so as to not increase any
parasitic capacitance significantly, which would slow the circuit
response time.
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
 use body tie contacts to connect the N-channel well to ground and the
p-channel well to supply.  What this does is to short the two bipolar
base regions to their respective emitters, such that the parasitic
bipolar transistors can never reach a conducting state.  However, these
body ties take up valuable circuit area, and so are used as sparsely as
is practical.  If these body ties are too far apart, the voltage drop
can become sufficient for thyristor action to start.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In this example, body ties and implanting the base of the trench,  are
deliberatly omitted, making this CMOS inverter particularly vulnerable to
thyristor action.  So much so that and SEU with an LET of unity, is sufficient
to trigger the CMOS inverter into a permanant conducting state, that can
be reset, as with any thyristor, by temporary removal of the supply voltage.
</p>
<p>
This example can be used as a starting point to investigate how the placement
of body ties and trench implantation techniques, will greatly increase the LET
value of an SEU strike that is required to make the circuit latch up.  The
higher the LET value required to make the circuit latch up, translates
directly, with an inverse relationship, into how often this will happen for any
given level of background cosmic or local radiation.
