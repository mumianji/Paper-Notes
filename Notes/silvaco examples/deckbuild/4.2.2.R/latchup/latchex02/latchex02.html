This example demonstrates a latch-up caused by a DC ramp in an npnp
structure typical of CMOS processes . The stages of this examples are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Definition of a CMOS layout to include a parasitic npnp structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface of the layout information to Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Process simulation of the npnp structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface of the structure to Atlas with automatic electrode specification
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Ramp of Vdd to cause latch-up using curve tracing algorithm.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The parasitic npnp device used is identical to the device in the
previous example. The use of MASKVIEWS and Athena to create this
structure is given in the description of that example. The initial part
of the Atlas run is also identical.
</p>
<p>
This file differs only in the manner of triggering the latch-up. A DC
ramp of the p+ contact in the n-well (named Vdd) is used as the
trigger. Once the voltage on Vdd exceeds the 5.0V on the nwell, the
p+/n-well junction is forward biased and latch-up may be triggered.
</p>
<p>
To
allow the complete holding voltage and current to be extracted simply,
the curve tracing algorithm in Atlas is used. The key command
is the
<b> curvetrace </b> statement coupled with &apos;solve curvetrace&apos;. The parameters on the trace
statement are used to set initial conditions and limits on the curve
tracing.  A detailed description of the use of this technique in tracing
IV curves with turning points can be found in the description of the
MOS snapback example.
</p>
<p>
The latch-up characteristic can be seen in the stored log file. It is
important to plot the current versus
<b> vdd int. bias </b> rather then &apos;vdd bias&apos;, since the former is the voltage actually
applied to the semiconductor and the latter includes the effect of the
load line used during the curve trace.

To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load  </b> button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file and any support
files to your current working directory. You
<b> cannot </b> run this file until the cross-section file is loaded. To do this go to
the DeckBuild menu
<b> Tools-&gt;MaskViews-&gt;Cutlines </b> Then select the name of the cross-section file from the list. The name
will be &quot;file&quot;.sec where &quot;file&quot; is the name of this example. Then press
<b> Load </b> on this Cutline menu. Once the cross-section file is loaded, select
<b> run </b> in DeckBuild to execute the example
