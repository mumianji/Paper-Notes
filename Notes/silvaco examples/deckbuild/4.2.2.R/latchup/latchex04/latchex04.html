This example demonstrates transient latch-up in a three-dimensional
npnp structure typical of CMOS processes. The stages of this examples
are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Definition of npnp structure in DEVEDIT3D
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting of a transient negative voltage pulse on the Vss contact to trigger latch-up
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The npnp  structure defined by DEVEDIT3D is a three dimensional one. The
n+ and p+ contacts do not fall in one 2D plane as in the previous
examples. They are arranged in a rectangle. The DEVICE3D module of
Atlas is required to simulate latch-up in this structure.
</p>
<p>
The structure is created using DEVEDIT3D either graphically or using the
command menus in DeckBuild. The most common technique is to form the
structure graphically, then save an input file containing all the
commands required to reproduce this structure. This input file can be
loaded into DeckBuild, and Atlas runs can be appended to it to create a file
similar to this one.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas, no special syntax is required to enter the DEVICE3D module as
opposed to 2D SPISCES. On reading a mesh file, Atlas will automatically
detect if it is two or three dimensional. The syntax for specifying
bipolar models and setting up the initial bias state are identical to
the two-dimensional cases described in the previous examples.
</p>
<p>
The command
<b> method halfimpl </b> chooses the half-implicit scheme for transient simulation. This scheme
significantly reduces the simulation time for many 3D transient
problems. In difficult cases more robust but slower methods might be
required. The transient pulse applied to the n+ contact in the pwell is
similar to the first example in this section.
</p>
<p>
Results from the log file show latch-up occurs as the device does not
return to its initial state after the pulse is over. The current is
still increasing at the end of the simulation which will eventually
cause device failure. It is possible to repeat this experiment varying
the the parameter
<b> t.final </b> in the statement:
<br/>
solve v4=-2.0 tfinal=4.5e-9 tstep=10.e-12
<br/>
If the voltage is held at -2.0V for shorter times latch-up may not occur.
