This example demonstrates a latch-up transient in an npnp structure
typical of CMOS processes. The stages of this examples are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Definition of a CMOS layout to include a parasitic npnp structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface of the layout information to Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Process simulation of the npnp structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface of the structure to Atlas with automatic electrode specification
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting of a transient negative voltage pulse on the Vss contact to trigger latch-up.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The process simulation for this example is defined using MASKVIEWS.
Users not familiar with the MASKVIEWS/Athena interface should read the
description under the ATHENA_SSUPREM4 examples section. Along with the
input file that can be seen by loading this example in to DeckBuild is
a layout file. The layout is of a CMOS well boundary with n+ and p+
contact layers. An n-p-n-p structure is formed by these layers. By
modifying the layers it is possible to misalign the contacts with
respect to the well boundary and repeat this latch-up simulation. Using
the MASKVIEWS/Athena interface avoids having to set etch coordinates
manually.
</p>
<p>
Along with the layout file, a MASKVIEWS cross-section file is copied to
the user&apos;s current working directory when &apos;Load&apos; is selected.
For this example, the cross-section information is indicated on the
<b> go athena</b> line at the top of the input file.  This is a cross section drawn by the
user through the layout. In this layout it is drawn through the center
of the n+ and p+ contacts.
</p>
<p>
The key syntax in Athena that load the mask edge coordinates are
<b> mask  </b> statements. A syntax sequence such as:
</p>
<p>
deposit alum thickness=0.05 div=2
<br/>
mask name=&quot;MET&quot;
<br/>
etch alum dry thickness=0.06
<br/>
strip
</p>
<p>
will deposit a metal layer, deposit photoresist, load the etch
coordinates of the layer defined in the cross section file as &apos;MET&apos;,
etch the photoresist pattern, etch the exposed metal with the specified
thickness, and then finally strip off all photoresist.
</p>
<p>
In the layout file, each area of metal (layer MET) was defined with a
name to be used as the name of the electrode associated with that area
of metal. Each of the n+ and p+ contacts were defined in this manner.
The statement
<b> autoelectrode </b> at the end of the Athena run will automatically define the electrodes
for Atlas.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas the material and model parameters are set first as usual.
Carrier lifetimes are set in the
<b> material </b> statement. These lifetimes will affect the gain of the parasitic
bipolar devices in this structure. Typical bipolar models are set. Here
all models are listed individually, but they could be replaced by the
macro
<b> models bip. </b> For latch-up, impact ionization must also be included. Two DC solve
statements are required to bias the device into the correct initial
voltage with 5V reverse bias between nwell and pwell.
</p>
<p>
Latch-up in this example will be caused by a transient pulse on the Vss
contact. This is defined by two solve statements. The first defines the
ramp to the negative voltage and the time at that voltage. The second
sets the time for the ramp down and the final simulation time.  If no
latch-up occurs, the device should return at the end of this transient
to the same state as at the beginning of the transient.
</p>
<p>
Latch-up is seen in the terminal characteristics as the current rises
during the negative pulse, begins to fall, but in the end keeps rising.
At the final simulation point the current is still rising and
eventually burn-out of the device would occur. The time taken for this
to occur could also be simulated by including lattice heating (using
GIGA) into this simulation.
</p>
<p>
Latch-up can also be seen in the internal distributions of carriers and
current density in the solution files generated by this example.

To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load  </b> button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file and any support
files to your current working directory. You
<b> cannot </b> run this file until the cross-section file is loaded. To do this go to
the DeckBuild menu
<b> Tools-&gt;MaskViews-&gt;Cutlines </b> Then select the name of the cross-section file from the list. The name
will be &lt;file&gt;.sec where &lt;file&gt; is the name of this example. Then press
<b> Load </b> on this Cutline menu. Once the cross-section file is loaded, select
<b> Run </b> in DeckBuild to execute the example
