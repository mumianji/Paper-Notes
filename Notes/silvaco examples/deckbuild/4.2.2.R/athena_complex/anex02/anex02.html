This example shows the fabrication of a trench isolation
structure using
<b> Elite </b> and
<b> SSuprem 4 </b> to model etching and oxidation processes.
</p>
<p>
The example begins with grid definition. This is tailored to
place fine grid in the area that will be exposed during the trench etch.
The
<b> INITIAL </b> statement does not specify a material type, so silicon is taken by default.
A background doping of boron with concentration 1.0e15 is specified.
The parameter
<b> NO.IMP </b> specifies that the entire simulation should neglect all processing
steps that introduce dopant into the structure.  This results
in a much faster calculation for diffusion and oxidation calculations
but will not produce a structure suitable for electrical analysis
because dopant will be left out. This is intended to provide
a fast mode of calculation that is useful for initial simulations.
The parameter
<b> SPACE.MULT </b> specifies that a coarser grid be used than that specified by the
<b> SPACING </b> parameter on the
<b> LINE </b> statements. This also is intended for fast initial runs of the simulator.
To disable these features for a more complete calculation, simply
delete the
<b> NO.IMP </b> and
<b> SPACE.MULT </b> parameters from the
<b> INITIALIZE </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
Following initialization, a nitride layer is deposited and patterned
by the
<b> DEPOSIT </b> and
<b> ETCH </b> statements. The structure is then reflected to create a symmetric
structure for trench etching.
</p>
<p>
The trench is performed by defining an etch machine with the
<b> RATE.ETCH </b> statement. For this etch, the etch rates for all materials except
silicon are assumed to be zero, so only rates for silicon are defined.
If other materials were to be etched, the rates for each material should be
set with a
<b> RATE.ETCH </b> statement.
For this etch process, the rates are defined for the
<b> RIE </b> model.  This simple model describes the etch process as a combination
of
<b> ISOTROPIC </b> and
<b> DIRECTIONAL </b> components.  The parameter
<b> U.M </b> specifies that the etch rates are given in units of microns per minute.
</p>
<p>
The etch is then performed for a period of 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Following the etch, the nitride masking layer is removed with the
<b> ETCH NITRIDE ALL </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The trench is then filled with a sandwich of materials. First a layer
of oxide is deposited with the simple conformal model. Then a layer of
polysilicon is deposited with the
<b> Elite </b> calculation. Finally, photoresist is deposited using
<b> Elite </b> to model the resist flow.  This is included by adding the parameters
<b> SMOOTH.WIN </b> and
<b> SMOOTH.STEP </b> to the deposit machine definition.  These two parameters specify
the width over which a simple averaging algorithm will be applied
and the number of times it will be applied respectively.  This results in
a smoothed profile that is a fast way of modeling the flowing resist
during deposit.
</p>
<p>
The structure coated with resist has a surface that is nearly
planar.  By applying an etch process that erodes all materials at
an equal rate, the planarization process can be modeled.  This is
performed next by specifying the etch rates for an
<b> Elite </b> type calculation using the
<b> WET.ETCH </b> model.  Following the etch, the grid on the surface of the structure
is relaxed to remove any excess grid that may have been introduced
during the etch process.  The parameter
<b> DX.SURF </b> on the
<b> RELAX </b> statement specifies the minimum surface segment size in microns for the
relax operation.
</p>
<p>
Next, a nitride layer is deposited and patterned to control the area that
will be oxidized.
</p>
<p>
Some model parameters are set for the oxidation using the
<b> METHOD </b> and
<b> OXIDE </b> statements.  Then the diffusion is performed in two steps, first in
dry oxygen specified using the
<b> DRYO2 </b> parameter, and then in water, specified by the
<b> WETO2 </b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the structure is plotted using
<b> TonyPlot </b> and the structure saved to a file.
