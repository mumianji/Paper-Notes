<b> NOTE: </b> <p>
This example works only on UNIX/LINUX computers.
</p>
<b> MaskViews  </b> <p>
is a product enabling the design of more than one device side by side.
For example, if an NMOS and a PMOS pair need to be considered side by
side, then
<b> MaskViews  </b> is used in conjunction with a single generic input file.
<b> MaskViews  </b> sends to the process simulator the mask, grid, boolean region and
electrode name information.
</p>
<p>
This example uses an IC Layout cross section along with a
generic process flow to realize a specific device.
To run this example, first invoke
<b> MaskViews  </b> from the
<b> Tools - MaskViews - Start MaskViews  </b> menu options. An IC Layout editor will appear. Create a cutline object by selecting the
<b> Write file  </b> button. Then select the beginning and end of the required cross section
on the layout itself. This action will generate a &apos;cutline object&apos; as a
file. (If used under the
<b> VWF  </b> the cutline object will be loaded into the
database). The cutline object contains 4 pieces of information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 masking information - where to place the photoresist or barrier
  </li>
  <li>
 grid information - automatically generated from a set of rules
  </li>
  <li>
 boolean regions information - defining regions of interest
  </li>
  <li>
 electrode names - for use in a later device test
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Load the cutline object into
<b> DeckBuild </b> by using the
<b> Tools - MaskViews - Cutlines  </b> menu option. Once loaded into
<b> DeckBuild</b> , press
<b> run</b> .
</p>
<p>
The completed run will relate directly to your IC layout cutline selection.
</p>
<p>
Note the use of the
<b> AUTOELECTRODE  </b> statement, used to refer any available electrode names at a particular
point in the process flow to a specific material region.
Electrode names may be associated with poly, metal or silicide regions.
The
<b> AUTOELECTRODE </b> statement will search from the top of the
structure until it finds an appropriate electrode material.
</p>
<p>
The lateral position of the electrode is determined from the
IC layout electrode mask position. Electrodes are named automatically,
half-way from the point where the cutline intercepts the
layout electrode polygon to the point where the cutline leaves the
electrode polygon.
</p>
<p>
The grid is derived from a set of rules relating to the edge
of each mask layer. These rules are defined under the :
<b> define - grid - x  </b> pop-up window within
<b> MaskViews</b> .
</p>
<p>
This example also demonstrates the use of
<b> MaskViews</b> , with a view to usage
under the Virtual Wafer Fab. When used under the
<b> VWF</b> , split lots may
include many devices, e.g. a P-channel and an N-channel MOS device.
</p>
<p>
To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load</b> button in DeckBuild &gt; Examples. This will copy the input file and any support files to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run</b> button in DeckBuild to execute the example.
