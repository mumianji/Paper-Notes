This example uses
<b> Optolith  </b> to show non-planar lithography over a complex topography created using
<b> SSuprem 4  </b> and
<b> Elite</b> .
</p>
<p>
The example begins with a silicon substrate that is 24 microns wide
and 1 micron deep.  Two parameters on the
<b> INITIALIZE  </b> statement specify that the no impurity (geometric) mode and
the coarse grid mode be employed.  The parameter
<b> NO.IMP  </b> specifies that the introduction of impurities
will be bypassed. This results in a much faster calculation for
many steps and still produces similar topographies to the calculation
including impurities.  For simulations that are concerned
primarily with topography, the no impurity mode can typically
be applied without loss of significant information.
</p>
<p>
The parameter
<b> SPACE.MULT  </b> specifies that all grid spacings specified by the parameter
<b> SPACING  </b> on the
<b> LINE </b> statement should be multiplied by the specified value.  This results
in a global grid coarsening by the specified factor.  This speeds the
simulation by reducing the discretization.
</p>
<p>
The process sequence begins with deposition of a thin oxide
to model the effect of gate oxidation. Next, nitride is deposited and
patterned simply by specifying the positions of a vertical
plane that defines the boundary of the etch region.
Following the nitride patterning, field oxidation is performed
and the nitride mask is stripped.
</p>
<p>
Next, gate polysilicon is deposited and patterned using the geometric
etch capability and a structure file is saved.
</p>
<p>
Following the structure file save, the structure is implanted.
Since the no impurity mode is being used, the implant step will be
ignored.  Next, the sidewall spacers are formed by depositing
oxide and etching it using the vertical etch model.  The source/drain
implant is performed next, but due to the use of the no impurity
mode, it is bypassed. The next step is the source/drain implant anneal.
This step runs much more quickly in no impurity mode.  This is
because impurity diffusion, which typically limits the time step size
during diffusion and causes more equations to be solved, does not
need to be calculated.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to deposit spin-on-glass. The glass deposition and
reflow process are approximated here by performing a deposit that includes
a geometric smoothing performed during the deposit. This is accomplished
by defining an
<b> Elite  </b> machine using the
<b> RATE.DEPO  </b> statement and including the parameters
<b> SMOOTH.WIN  </b> and
<b> SMOOTH.STEP  </b> as part of the statement. The
<b> Elite</b> machine is invoked by specifying the
<b> DEPOSIT  </b> statement with the
<b> MACHINE  </b> parameter used to specify the previously defined machine.
</p>
<p>
The next sequence of process steps deposits photoresist, patterns the resist
with the geometric etch capability, defines a wet etch machine and
employs that machine on the structure, defines a directional
etch machine and employs that machine on the structure, saves
the structure, and strips the photoresist.
</p>
<p>
Following this, a short wet etch is performed to remove fillets from the
structure, and aluminum is deposited using the
<b> Elite</b> hemispherical model.
</p>
<p>
Next, photoresist is deposited using the same geometric smoothing approach that is applied to model spin-on-glass reflow. This results in a nearly planar top surface following the resist deposit.
The parameter
<b> NAME.RESIST  </b> specifies the type of resist that will be used from the library of
resists included in the models file. In this case, the photoresist
named OiR32 is applied.
</p>
<p>
After the resist is deposited, the simulation begins the
<b> Optolith   </b> portion of the process. This performs a detailed analysis of the
photolithographic process of this final structure.
<b> Optolith  </b> simulation begins by performing imaging.  The
<b> ILLUMINATION</b> ,
<b> ILLUM.FILTER</b> ,
<b> PROJECTION</b> ,  and
<b> PUPIL.FILTER  </b> statements describe the illumination system.  The
<b> LAYOUT  </b> statements define two mask features. The parameter
<b> LAY.CLEAR  </b> removes any previously defined layout information so that a new layout can be
initialized.  Once the illumination system and the layout have been
defined, the imaging module is invoked. The
<b> IMAGE  </b> statement invokes the imaging module and specifies the
window in which imaging will be performed.  The parameter
<b> DX  </b> specifies the discretization along the x-dimension and the parameter
<b> ONE.D  </b> specifies that the imaging should consider only one dimension. The
parameter
<b> CLEAR  </b> specifies that the mask should be considered as a clear field
with dark features defined by the
<b> LAYOUT  </b> statements.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> OPTICAL  </b> statement defines the index of refraction for BPSG material at
a wavelength of 0.365 microns.  The
<b> EXPOSE   </b> statement performs the resist exposure from the results of the
imaging module.
</p>
<p>
Following exposure, the
<b> BAKE  </b> statement performs post-exposure bake and calculates the diffusion
of the photoactive component.  Finally, resist development
is performed using the
<b> DEVELOP  </b> statement. The
<b> MACK </b> model is specified along with the development
<b> TIME  </b> , number of
<b> STEPS </b> at which regridding will be performed, and
the number of non-regridded
<b> SUBSTEPS  </b> that will be taken per step.
</p>
<p>
Finally the results of the simulation are plotted using
<b> TonyPlot  </b> .  The non-ideal features in the photoresist due to reflections from the
underlying topography can be seen in the lines of resist that remain.
