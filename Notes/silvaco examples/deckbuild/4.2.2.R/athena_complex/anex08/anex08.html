This example shows the use of
<b> DevEdit </b> in a mesh adaptation application. A trench is etched with an
<b> Elite </b> etch machine. A highly doped oxide is
then deposited inside the trench for sidewall doping.  Boron segregation
and transport coefficients are defined. (These parameters may be used
to calibrate the amount of out diffusion of boron.)
</p>
<p>
A short heat cycle segregates out some of the boron from the oxide
into the silicon trench sidewall.
</p>
<b> DevEdit </b> <p>
is then invoked to regrid the structure based upon the
concentration gradient of the boron and phosphorous. The weight for
each impurity will determine the distance from the diffusion front that
the grid is refined. These parameters should be used in relation to the
estimated subsequent diffusion profile.
</p>
<b> DevEdit </b> <p>
is invoked at a point where minimal material boundary points exist to minimize
the mesh density. This is a preferred although not essential method of use.
</p>
<p>
Next,
<b> Athena </b> is re-invoked and again the segregation and transport
coefficients are defined in the new
<b> Athena </b> session.
</p>
<p>
A second diffusion is started, and the boron diffusion front now moves
within the refined mesh region.
</p>
<b> DevEdit </b> <p>
may be used in this manner to refine at any stage during a process
flow.
