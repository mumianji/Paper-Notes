This example shows the dose-dependence effect on patterning over a non-planar structure. The structure with symmetrical trench is created and saved in the
<b> anopex21.str </b> file for subsequent lithography simulation. Also, the intensity distribution corresponding to a simple layout with the main feature aligned with the center
of the trench is calculated and saved in the
<b> anopex21_int.str </b> file.
</p>
<p>
Two separate exposure-bake-development simulation sequences are performed. The
first one uses the constant refraction index (n0 = 1.4 + i * 0.02) specified in
the OPTICAL statement. In the second simulation the refraction index varies
linearly with dose from n0 to n1=1.6 + i * 0.04. The comparison of final
structures shows that the &quot;dose effect&quot; could be very strong. In the constant
refraction index case the strong reflections from the walls with subsequent &quot;undercut&quot; during development may even result in complete removal of the feature.
