This example is a six-transistor, three metal, single poly SRAM cell.
The cell consists of four NMOS and two PMOS transistors.
</p>
<p>
The layout file defines various layers up to metal 3.  The rule file
exports six new masks, plus CLEVER defines another two masks -
<b> *GATE </b> and
<b> *CONT.  </b> These masks are gates and contacts, which are the NGATE and PGATE
regions, plus the two exported contacts.  The modified layout
and a SPICE netlist of the devices are saved after the
original layout file is initialized in the command file
and the rule file executed in the command file.
</p>
<p>
The gate oxide is defined as a separate material, called
<b> Gateox,</b> distinct from silicon oxide.
<b> Gateox </b> is given a very low (but non-zero) permittivity.  As a result,
the area calculation of
capacitance (i.e. determined by the transistor gate area over the
gate oxide and silicon) is very low.  This area capacitance of the
gate over silicon is accurately calculated in
the SPICE model (since only the area and gate oxide thickness are
necessary).  Since CLEVER calculates the total field solution, it does
not distinguish the contribution of the capacitance due to the poly gate
over the silicon from either the fringe effects or capacitance with
other conducting lines.  This methodology of artificially lowering the
area capacitance in CLEVER avoids calculating this value twice,
once in CLEVER, and once again in the SPICE model.

The geometry of the structure is the idealized Manhattan cross-sections.
No advanced lithographic or etch models are used.

This example is also discussed in the CLEVER tutorial in the manual.
