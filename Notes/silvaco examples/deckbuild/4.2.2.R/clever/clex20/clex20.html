Micro-loading etching effects describe the phenomenon whereby the effective
material etch rate depends on the hole size of the pattern masking layer.
</p>
<p>
This can be simulated using the advanced etching module in Victory Process.
Once the structure is created, it is loaded into Clever to simulate back end
parasitics.
</p>
<p>
The etch machine characteristics are described by the Fux, Topography and
EtchDepoProperties statements.  Once the etch machine has been described, the
wafer is loaded into this virtual etch machine and is etched for 4 minutes.
The created trench structures are then filled with aluminum.
</p>
<p>
For ease of observation of the micro-loading effects, a 2D cut line of the
3D structure is created and plotted, where it can be clearly seen that the
depth of each trench is dependent on the width of the trench.
