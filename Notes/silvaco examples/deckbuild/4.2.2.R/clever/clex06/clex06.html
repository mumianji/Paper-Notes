This example is based upon an EXNOR custom cell layout and illustrates how CLEVER may be used to extract the full parasitic netlist from a complete cell.
</p>
<p>
Beginning from the process description, a 3-dimensional structure is created from which the resistance and capacitance are extracted using a field solver. The
<b> Adapt</b> parameter on the
<b> Interconnect</b> statement is used to specify the accuracy required by the field solver. The values of 0.1 and 0.05 require an accuracy of +/- 10% and 5% respectively.
</p>
<p>
Once the netlist is extracted it may be used in a SPICE input deck to anlayse the influence of cell parasitics on circuit performance.
When this example is loaded support files that may be run in SmartSpice to show the circuit behaviour will also be loaded.
</p>
<p>
This example has been described within the CLEVER tutorial in the manual. For further information on this example please read the CLEVER tutorial chapter.
