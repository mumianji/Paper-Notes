In this case we demonstrate how to use the Victory Process 3D Structure Editor
to create the &quot;L&quot; shaped metal region, often found in custom cells, which is
insulated from the silicon substrate by a 0.5um oxide layer. The processing
steps are very simple requiring only etching and deposition.
</p>
<p>
As is also the case with any CLEVER simulation the process etching steps are
driven from a layout file generated from MaskViews. This file is included in
the support files when this example is loaded.
</p>
<p>
The deposition model remains the relatively simple model used and described in
example clex01.in.  However, for the etching process, this example has combined
the non-manhattan angular etch model in example clex02.in with the physical
lithographic masking and imaging from example clex03.in.  The structure
produced from this combination of models should therefore simulate reality to
a much greater extent than the previous examples.
</p>
<p>
Once the process simulation is complete, the three-dimensional structure is
saved with the
<b> Export</b> statement and can be plotted using
<b> TonyPlot3d.</b> </p>
<p>
The structure created in the Victory Process 3D Structure Editor, is then
loaded into Clever and the interconnect parasitic extraction is carried out
using the
<b> Interconnect statement. </b> Firstly, however, the material parameters of silicon are defined using the
<b> Material statement</b> so that in this case silicon &quot;inherits&quot; the same material properties as
oxide. In this example only the parasitic capacitance values are calculated
from the field solver. During this calculation automatic mesh adaption is
performed with the
<b> Adapt</b> parameter whereby the mesh is modified until the error in the capacitance
extraction is reduced to the default maximum of 5% of the capacitance. The
structure and the SPICE netlist are then saved.
