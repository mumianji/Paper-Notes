This example is identical to example clex06.in except that the etching models
have been upgraded to a more physical 87 degree side-wall.
The same EXNOR custom cell layout is used and illustrates how CLEVER may be
used to analyse the effect of the etching model on a complex custom cell.

<p>
The extracted netlist may be used in a SmartSpice input deck to analyse the
circuit performance which can then be compared to the previous example.
</p>
<p>
When this example is loaded support files, that may be run in SmartSPice to
show the circuit behaviour, will also be loaded.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that the high resolution geometries created by the realistic
physical process models used in this example require a usable memory of
approximately 300MB to run the parameter extraction programs due to the
intricate mesh thus created.  The simulation can be run on machines with less
memory but the program may take a significantly longer time to run due
memory swapping between the RAM and hard disk.
