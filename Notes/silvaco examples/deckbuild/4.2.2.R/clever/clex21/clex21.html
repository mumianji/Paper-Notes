This example demonstrates how to:-
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Include well isolation depletion capacitance in the calculation.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Include source/drain depletion capacitance in the calculation.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specify cyclical cell boundary conditions for emulating cascaded cells.
  </li>
</ul>
<b> Including Well Capacitance in the Field Solver Parasitic Extraction</b> <p>
Diode isolated wells can be treated as a separate volume of silicon that is
separated from the bulk wafer by a layer of insulator where the insulator
thickness is the silicon depletion width and the insulator has the same
permitivity as silicon.
</p>
<p>
For a first order calculation, the depletion width of a diode separated well
or source/drain region increases with the square root of the doping
concentration of the lowest doped side of the junction.  If you don&apos;t
know the depletion width of the junctions, a good approximation can be
obtained from the following formula:
</p>
<p>
Depletion Width (um) = SQRT ( 1e15 / Doping )
</p>
<p>
where the Doping is the volume doping of the lightly doped side of the
junction in atoms/cm3.  So for 1e15/cm3 doping, use 1um, for 1e17/cm3,
use 0.1um and for 1e19/cm3 use 0.01um etc.
</p>
<p>
In this example, the depletion region of the N-Well is simulated by first
etching the silicon to the depth of the N-Well in the masked N-Well regions,
and then by depositing a  0.1um thick film of a user defined material called
<b> &quot;Nwell_Depletion&quot;</b> which is assigned a permittivity of 11.8 to match the permittivity of
silicon.  The presumption here is that the nwell is bounded by a volume
p-doping concentration of approximately 1e17/cm3.  Finally, the N-Well is
then filled with silicon to represent the neutral region of the N-Doped well.
</p>
<b> Including Well Capacitance in the Field Solver Parasitic Extraction</b> <p>
Simulating the Source/Drain diodes is the same process as the N-Well
procedure described above, but with a thinner depletion insulating region
of 0.02um to represent the higher doping in these regions.  The depletion
capacitance of the source-drain diodes is simulated by using a user defined
material called
<b> &quot;SD_Depletion&quot;</b> and assigning it a permittivity of 11.8.  If you wish to remove this
capacitance from the SPICE Netlist because it is decided to use the
source/drain capacitance assigned to the active device model, then
define the user defined material called &quot;SD_Depletion&quot;, a permittivity value
of say 0.1 such that the capacitance calculated will add less than 1% error
to the SPICE Model Capacitance.  Do not assign any insulator a permittivity
of zero, as this will cause discontinuities in the field solver
</p>
<b> Specifying Cyclical Cell Boundary Conditions for Emulating Cascaded Cells</b> <p>
The simulated Inverter Cell in this example is cascadable such that numerous
identical cells could be cascaded together to make a ring oscillator.  For
this application, it is more appropriate to specify
<b> &quot;CYCLIC&quot;</b> boundary conditions rather that the default
<b> &quot;MIRROR&quot;</b> boundary conditions.  To specify CYCLIC boundary conditions, on the
Interconnect Statement, specify:
</p>
<b>   DomainBoundaryCondition=&quot;CYCLIC&quot;</b> <p>
