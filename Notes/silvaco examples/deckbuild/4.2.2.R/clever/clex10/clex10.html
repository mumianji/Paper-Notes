An inverter is one of the most common cells found in layouts. This example
contains one inverter cell designed with 4 NMOS and 4 PMOS transistors.
It is an illustration of how Clever inserts auxilliary nodes, as in example
clex05.in, where necessary into the layout.
The back-annotated layout may then be re-plotted in Maskviews.

This example applies lithographic techniques to more accurately simulate the
non-uniform barrier layer, formed by the resist after the imaging
photolithographic stage.  Victory Process is called upon once again to simulate
the non Manhatton structure creation.  The etching process also uses a more
physical 87 degree angled side-wall.

This example has been used in the CLEVER Tutorial and more information on it
can be found there.
