A useful option included within Clever is its ability to operate in 2D or 1D
mode.  This greatly reduces simulation time and allows the user to
check that important aspects of the process are correctly implemented.
</p>
<p>
This example consists of three layers of metal to illustrate the use of the
<b> Cut line </b> feature in order to generate a 2D simulation.  The example then goes on to
perform the full 3D simulation of the same structure.  It will be noted that
the 3D simulation takes significantly longer to perform tasks such as the
capcitance matrix calculation.
</p>
<p>
This example also demonstrates the use of the
<b> box</b> command which forces Clever to increase the effective mask size by using the given
coordinate around the edge of the masks leading to a 3D simulation.
This ensures that fringing capacitances are better accounted for by increasing
the volume around the perimeter which is meshed therefore increasing the
volume within which fringing field lines are solved.
</p>
<p>
Comparison of the 3D and 2D capacitance matricies yields the expected result of
larger capacitances for the 3D simulation.  This is because fringing
capacitances in the 2D simulation in the Z direction are effectively eliminated.
Notice the greatly reduced capacitance in the 2D calculation for non adjacent
layers which are effectively shielded in the Z direction.  Compare these
results with the full 3D simulation where significant fringing capacitance
occurs along the length of the structures.
</p>
<p>
Once the process simulation is complete the three-dimensional structure is
saved with the
<b> Save</b> statement and can be plotted using
<b> TonyPlot3d.</b> </p>
