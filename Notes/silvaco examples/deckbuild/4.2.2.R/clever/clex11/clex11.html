Modern designs make use of mask layers which are not always at right angles to each other. The layout used in this example illustrates a 45 degree angle for certain mask layers.
This would normally make the calculation of parasitic resistances very difficult, but with CLEVER this is handled easily.
</p>
<p>
In many cases the back-end processing makes use of different non-standard materials for the insulators and the metal conductors.
</p>
<p>
This example is based upon the simulation of an SRAM cell which consists of four different metal layers, plus polysilicon.
</p>
<p>
The initial processing stages demonstrate how Clever allows deposition of user-defined materials. Once the structure has been created these new materials can then be displayed within TonyPlot3D.
</p>
<p>
Before the parasitic extraction takes place using the
<b> Interconnect</b> statement, the physical parameters of the new materials are defined using the
<b> Material</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
This example has been used in the CLEVER tutorial in the manual and further information may be obtained there.
