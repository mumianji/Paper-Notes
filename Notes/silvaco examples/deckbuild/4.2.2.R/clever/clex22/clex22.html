This example illustrates using Clever to simulate the physics in Liquid Crystal
films.  Liquid crystal films consist of long molecules, called
<b> directors </b> which rotate in response to applied electric fields, that effectively supplies
a rotational torque.  The permittivity and hence the capacitance of these LCD
films, is highly directional and dependent on the the orientation of the long
molecules (directors). When an electric field is applied which rotates these
molecules, the capacitance in the direction across the film, can change
dramatically.  Clever simulates this physics, in order to calculate the voltage
(field) dependent capacitance of LCD layers.
</p>
<p>
The directional permittivities of the LCD versus director angle are defined in
the
<b> setLC </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The layers which interface the LCD film can anchor the LCD molecules in a fixed
direction, regardless of applied field.  This creates an increasing angular
rotation of the LCD molecules with applied field, the further they are away
from these anchored interface regions.  These physical effects are also
included in the simulations.  Specifying these fixed interface angles for top
and bottom interfaces is executed by the statements
<b> LCbndaryT </b> and
<b> LCbndaryB </b> </p>
<p>
Clearly, if an applied voltage changes the permittivity of a film, the stored
charge and capacitance is also voltage dependent. Since Q=CxV, where Q is
stored charge, C is layer capacitance in a particular direction and V is
applied voltage, mathematical instability can result at certain applied
voltages due to the inter-dependence of all three parameters.  The purpose of
the
<b> cPenalty</b> parameter, is to introduce a modicum of numerical damping, to calm these
numerical instabilities.
