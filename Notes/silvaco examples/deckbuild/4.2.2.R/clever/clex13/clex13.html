This example demonstrates the use of CLEVER to analyze non planerised structures
such as local interconnects commonly used in current sources and in memory
cells.  To emphasise the true 3D capability CLEVER, a MOSFET with
TiN (titanium nitride) local interconnect between drain and gate is
implemented using a trench isolation structure together with realistic layer
depositions.
</p>
<p>
The 3D structure is created using the 3D process simulator Victory Process,
and is then loaded into Clever for the resiistance extraction.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the 3D process simulation, a 2D cutline of the structure is
plotted to show a representative cross sectional view of the created device.
This 2D cross section may be plotted without running the simulation from the
stored structure file called &quot;clex13_2D.str&quot; by using the standard
<b> tonyplot</b> program.  The 3 dimensional structure file can be plotted using
<b> tonyplot3d.</b> It should be noted that when using the
<b> padding</b> command to create a wider boarder around the masks in conjunction with the
<b> cut line</b> statement, a warning in the runtime output will occur informing the user that
the cutline defined is larger than the mask area.  This is to be expected since
the padding command generates a larger simulation volume.  This warning can
therefore be ignored.
</p>
<p>
The resistance of the local interconnect is extracted using the
<b> Interconnect Resistance Adapt</b> statement in the usual way after defining the conductivity of the TiN material.
The value of the extracted resistance is stored in clex14.net.
