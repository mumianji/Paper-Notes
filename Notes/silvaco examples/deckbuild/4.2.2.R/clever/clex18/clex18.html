We show in this example that CLEVER can be used with a gds2 layout format
as input. The commands used are
<b> GDS2=&quot;layout.gds&quot;</b> and
<b> cell=&quot;cell_number1&quot; </b> which allow the user to load a gds2file  and select a specific cell in the layout.
</p>
<p>
Netlist reduction for capacitance and resistance extraction are also available
in CLEVER. Since we perform the capacitance and resistance extraction with one
Interconnect command, we need to define two different minvalues. Therefore
the keywords
<b> minRES</b> and
<b> minCAP </b> have to be set in the
<b> Interconnect </b> command like:
</p>
<p>
Interconnect minRES = 0.001 minCAP=1.0e-18.
</p>
<p>
Finally we show in this example that the Interconnect statement was extended
by the option
<b> Contact = &lt;string&gt;.</b> This allows the user to specify one particular conductor for which
CLEVER extracts the capacitance values with respect to all other
conductors. If more than one interconnect statements are invoked during
the course of the simulation, the last results of capacitance calculation
will replace the previously calculated values that already exist in the
netlist.
