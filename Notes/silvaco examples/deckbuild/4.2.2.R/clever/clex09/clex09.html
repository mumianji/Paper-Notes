An inverter is one of the most common cells found in layouts. This example
contains one inverter cell designed with 4 NMOS and 4 PMOS transistors.
It is an illustration of how Clever inserts auxilliary nodes, as in example
clex05.in, where necessary into the layout.
The back-annotated layout may then be re-plotted in Maskviews.

<p>
In this example, the etching process has the more physical 87 degree angled
side-wall, so the structure was created using VictoryPorcess in cell mode.

This example has been used in the CLEVER Tutorial and more information on it
can be found there.
