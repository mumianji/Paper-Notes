This example demonstrates the ability of CLEVER
to deposit and field solve non planarised, multi-layer films for interconnect
capacitance analysis using CLEVER.
The simulation is run in 2D
as there is little to be gained by running the demonstration in 3D.  The user
may force the simulator to do the full 3D simulation by simply commenting
out the
<b> cut line</b> statement, together with the TonyPlot statement (since in this case there will
be no 2D structure for TonyPlot to plot).  As with example 14, the message:
</p>
<i> Warning: point is outside of layout domain</i> <p>
in the runtime output may be ignored since the program is merely informing the
user that the cut line is bigger than the mask size due to the use of the
<b> padding</b> statement which creates a larger boarder volume in order to improve accuracy.
