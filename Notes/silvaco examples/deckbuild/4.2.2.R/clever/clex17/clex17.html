This example creates the same SRAM design as in clex16, but uses the Victory
Process simulator to create a more realsitic structure.
</p>
<p>
The more realistic structure is a result of three features in Victory Process:
</p>
<p>
Fisrstly, an optical solver creates an optical intensity map during photoresist
exposure from a user specifiable deep-UV light source, through a lens of user
specifiable numerical aperture (0.5 in this particular case).  The mask can
also be deliberately defocussed by a user specifyable distance in um, above or
below the surface of the photoresist, using the
<b> &quot;maskdefocus&quot;</b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, photoresist mask development profile is calculated from an intensity
contour map specifyable by the user as developing somewhere between zero
intensity, and full intensity represented by specifying the
<b> &quot;criticalintensity&quot;</b> parameter.  A value of 0.5 was used in this example.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly once the photoresist mask pattern has been simulated, a geometric etch
feature is used to create sloped sidewalls of 87 degrees relative to horizontal.
