CLEVER is used in this example to simulate an &quot;L&quot; shaped metal region, often found in custom cells, which is insulated from the silicon substrate by a
0.5um oxide layer. The processing steps are very simple requiring only etching and deposition.
</p>
<p>
As with any CLEVER simulation the process etching steps are driven from a layout file generated from MaskViews. This file will be included in the support files when this example is loaded.
</p>
<p>
A more advanced etching model is used compared with the previous example. In this model etching is performed along a material boundary at a specified
<b> Rate</b> and
<b> Time</b> . An
<b> Isotropic</b> component is also specified so that etching is performed laterally as well as vertically. This results in the &quot;non-manhattan&quot;
geometry where the sidewalls are no longer vertical but may have a &quot;slope&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Once the process simulation is complete, the three-dimensional structure is saved with the
<b> Save</b> statement and can be plotted using
<b> TonyPlot3d.</b> </p>
<p>
Finally the interconnect parasitic extraction is carried out using the
<b> Interconnect</b> statement. Firstly, however, the material parameters of silicon are defined using the
<b> Material</b> statement so that in this case silicon &quot;inherits&quot; the same material properties as silicon. In this example only the parasitic capacitance values are calculated
from the field solver. During this calculation automatic mesh adaption is performed with the
<b> Adapt</b> parameter whereby the mesh is modified until the error in the capacitance extraction is reduced to the default maximum of 5% of the capacitance. The structure and the SPICE netlist are then saved.
