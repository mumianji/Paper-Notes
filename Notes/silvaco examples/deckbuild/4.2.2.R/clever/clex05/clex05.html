CLEVER is used in this example to simulate a more complex interconnect metal path.
Such a complex shape adds additional problems to the extraction of the parasitics, especially the resistance along the metal lines.
</p>
<p>
The metal regions defined in this example have a number of electrodes, specified within their boundaries.
As such it is clear that when the simulator extracts the resistance between electrodes certain regions along the metal path could be taken into account more than once.
</p>
<p>
To overcome this problem Clever will automatically subdivide the metal line into individual electrodes so that no region is included more than once in the parasitic resistances.
These additional nodes are then back annotated onto the layout which is then re-saved at the end of the simulation.
