This example simulates the Ids/Vgs characteristics of a thick film SOI MOSFET and from these results extracts the threshold voltage and subthreshold slope. These are two key parameters involved in the design of any SOI MOSFET.  It demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Basic SOI structure definition using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting transport models including impact ionization
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Generating an Ids/Vgs curve with Vds=0.1V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Extracting threshold voltage and subthreshold slope from the results
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Plotting output curves and structures.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The SOI device is a partially depleted device composed of a 0.2 micron
layer of silicon on a 0.4 micron silicon dioxide substrate.  The
device has a 17 nm thick gate oxide and a gate length of 1.0 microns.
For simplicity there is no silicon below the back oxide. Other examples
in this section do include a silicon substrate.
</p>
<p>
The device mesh, region specification and electrode definition are performed using the
<b> mesh, region </b> and
<b> electrode </b> statements at the start of the input file. The doping is added as
simple analytical functions. The channel doping in this simple example
is presumed a constant. Gaussian source and drain profiles are used. No
LDD or spacer is considered in this case.
</p>
<p>
After the structure description, the
<b> interface </b> statement is used to define fixed oxide charges on both silicon - silicon
dioxide interfaces.  Next the
<b> contact </b> statement is used to specify the workfunction on the poly-silicon gate.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> model </b> statement is used to specify a reasonable set of physical models for
SOI simulation.  In this case, concentration dependent mobility,
SRH recombination, Auger recombination, band-gap narrowing, and
parallel electric field dependent mobility are specified.
</p>
<p>
After the initial solution, a negative gate voltage is applied followed by solutions at drain biases
of 0.05 and 0.1 volts are obtained. Next, the
<b> log </b> statement is used to specify a file for collection of the Id/Vgs
characteristics of the SOI device. These characteristics are captured
with the following
<b> solve </b> statement where the gate bias is ramped in 0.1 volt increments from
-0.2 volts up to 1.5 volt.
</p>
<p>
After the voltages have been solved
<b> extract </b> statements are used to find the threshold voltage and the subthreshold slope of the SOI MOSFET.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the resultant Id/Vgs curve is plotted using TonyPlot.
