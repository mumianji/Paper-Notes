This example compares Ids/Vds  analyses of a short channel
ultra-thin SOI transistor with Energy Balance (EB) and Nonisothermal Energy
Balance Models (NEB). It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 SOI structure formation using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of energy balance and lattice heating models
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of numerical methods for coupled solution technique
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vds simulation for Vgs=4.0V
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The example file consists of two runs. The first simulates the device
using energy balance models, the second using energy balance and
lattice heating models combined.
</p>
<p>
Submicron devices should be simulated using the Energy Balance Model due to
velocity overshoot, and nonlocal impact ionization effects, which could
substantially influence device characteristics.  For high current
levels (high gate voltages) the thermal self-heating effects could also
play an important role decreasing mobility and impact ionization rate.
These effects are very pronounced in SOI transistors due to low heat
conductivity of the oxide. This leads to the negative output
conductance. This example demonstrates comparison of Ids/Vds curves
obtained with Energy Balance and Nonisothermal Energy Balance Models.
</p>
<p>
The first Atlas run uses the Energy Balance Model: Poisson&apos;s equation,
carrier continuity equations, and the energy balance equation for electrons
are solved self-consistently.
</p>
<p>
The device is described in the first part of the input file. The SOI
device is composed of a 0.05 micron layer of silicon on a 0.45 micron
silicon dioxide substrate.  The device has a 12 nm thick gate oxide and
a gate length of 0.8 microns. Effective channel length is 0.5
microns.
</p>
<p>
After the device description, the
<b> material </b> statement is used to assign an energy relaxation time for electrons.
The
<b> models hcte.el </b> statement is used to set the solution for electron energy balance.
Other parameters on the model statement select a set of physical models
for this simulation.  In this case, these models are CONSRH and AUGER
recombination, the conmob and fldmob mobility model and Band Gap Narrowing.
The
<b> impact length.rel lrel.el=0.02</b> statement is used to assign the energy relaxation length for Selberherr model.
The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to assign the work function on the polysilicon gate.
</p>
<p>
The gate voltage is ramped to 4V. At this stage the combined algorithm is used:
<b> method gummel newton carr=2</b> . Thus if convergence is not reached in decoupled mode (gummel)
the simulator will automatically switch to coupled mode (newton).  Then
the drain voltage is ramped. Again the combined algorithm is used for low
drain biases and full newton scheme for higher drain biases.
The method statement also defines that a two carrier solution is performed using
<b> carr=2 </b> whereby Atlas will solve Poisson&apos;s equation for potential and the electron and hole continuity equations.
</p>
<p>
The second Atlas run uses Nonisothermal Energy Balance Model: Poisson&apos;s
equation, carrier continuity equations, energy balance equation for
electrons, and a lattice energy balance equation are solved
self-consistently.
</p>
<p>
The same set of models is used, except that the solution of the  lattice energy
balance equation is activated using lat.temp parameter in the
<b> models </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
In addition, thermal boundary conditions should be defined in this case.
Thermal boundary conditions are defined in the
<b> thermcontact </b> statement.  A 300K temperature is specified at the thermcontact located along the bottom
of the device. Thermal isolation conditions are assumed on all other surfaces.
</p>
<p>
Id/Vds curves from the two simulations can be compared in TonyPlot.
Internal variables at the same bias point can also be compared using
the saved solution files. Plots of impact ionization rate and electron
temperature show the effect of the elevated temperature in the silicon
film of these quantities.
