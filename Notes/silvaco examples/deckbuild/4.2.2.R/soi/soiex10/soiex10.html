This example shows how a body contact on
an SOI NMOSFET can suppress a kink in the IdVd curve that is due to the
effects of impact ionization. The effect of lattice heating is also shown.
</p>
<p>
This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Definition of 3D SOI MOSFET structures using Victory Process
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 The use and effect of a body contact in a 3D MOSFET geometry
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calculation of lattice-heating effects
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of impact ionization effects
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first Victory Process section in this example defines a basic SOI NMOSFET.
Although the geometry of this device is essentially two-dimensional,
it is here defined and simulated in 3D so that the results can be
directly compared with those from a 3D MOSFET with a body contact.
Using a tetrahedral mesh, the first MOSFET structure is saved to
the file vdex02_0_0.str, from which it is imported into Victory Device.
</p>
<p>
In Victory Device, the statement
<b> ELECTRODE SUBSTRATE </b> ensures that the substrate of this device is recognized as an electrode,
which will be held at ground potential. The succeeding
<b> CONTACT </b> statement assigns to the gate the workfunction of n-type polysilicon.
The
<b> MODELS </b> statement is used to specify the particular models to be used during
the simulation. In this example, they include:
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 CVT: 
A general purpose mobility model including concentration,
temperature, parallel field and transverse field dependence.
<br/>
   </li>
  <li>
 SRH: 
Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 AUGER: 
Auger recombination.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 BGN: 
Bandgap narrowing in the presence of heavy doping.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to these models, the
<b> IMPACT SELB </b> statement specifies that the Selberherr model for impact ionization
will be used.
</p>
<p>
Now some special steps must be taken, because the MOSFET used in this
example is not especially stable.  That makes it difficult to obtain a
consistently steady numerical solution. To facilitate this, we adjust
some solver parameters by means of
<b> METHOD </b> statements.
</p>
<p>
Once the contacts, models, and methods have been specified, the simulation
begins with a
<b> SOLVE INIT </b> to initialize the solution at zero bias. Next a small initial bias is put
upon the drain, and then the gate is brought up to its operating bias of 3 V.
The bias on the drain is then ramped from 0.2 V up to 4 V, and the IdVd
curve saved to the logfile vdex02_0_2.log.
</p>
<p>
After this, the entire simulation is repeated for this structure, but this
time considering lattice heating effects. The
<b> CONTACT </b> and
<b> MATERIAL </b> statements assign to the gate contact the workfunction, heat capacity,
and thermal conductivity of n-type polysilicon. The
<b> THERMCONTACT </b> statement here defines a thermal contact at the substrate, and specifies
that it will be maintained at 300 K.
</p>
<p>
Once the gate has been biased, lattice temperature
simulation is activated by the statement
<b> MODELS LAT.TEMP</b> . The drain is then biased as before, and the IdVd curve is
saved to the logfile vdex02_0_4.log.
</p>
<p>
The second Victory Process section defines a MOSFET with an additional body contact,
beside the gate. The difference between this structure and the first one can
be seen by comparing vdex02_1_0.str and vdex02_0_0.str in
<b> TonyPlot3D</b> .
</p>
<p>
As with the first structure, simulations are run with and without lattice
heating effects. With the addition of the body contact (at 0 V), however,
the device is much more stable. The IdVd curves are written to the log files
vdex02_1_2.log and vdex02_1_4.log, and all four IdVd curves generated in
this example are compared in
<b> TonyPlot</b> . This comparison clearly shows that the addition of the body contact suppresses
the kink in the curves, which is due to the effects of impact ionization.
</p>
<p>
In
<b> TonyPlot3D</b> , you can examine the structure files vdex02_0_1.str and vdex02_1_1.str to
compare the impact ionization patterns for the two devices, and the
structure files vdex02_0_2.str and vdex02_1_2.str to compare the heat fluxes
as well as other lattice heating effects.
