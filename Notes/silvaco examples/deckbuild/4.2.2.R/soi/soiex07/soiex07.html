This example demonstrates Ids/Vgs and Id/Vds  3D analysis of a short
channel ultra-thin SOI transistor with body contact. Such
simulations cannot be performed using a 2D simulator because the body
electrode is located in the out of the plane of the drain, gate and
source. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Formation of 3D structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vgs solution with Vds=0.1V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vds solution with Vgs=1.5V
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The formation of this 3D structure is performed using the Atlas syntax.
The syntax used is very similar to that in the previous 2D example. The
definition of dimensions in the third direction is defined by the
<b> z </b> indicator. Thus z.min and z.max define extents in the z direction, just
as x.min and x.max do in the x direction.
</p>
<p>
The SOI device is composed of a 0.05 micron layer of silicon on a 0.45
micron silicon dioxide substrate.  The device has a 12 nm thick gate
oxide and a gate length of 0.8 microns (effective channel length is 0.5
microns).  The gate width is 2.5um. The body contact location is
defined by the following statement
</p>
<b> elec  num=4  x.min=2.8 x.max=3.6 y.min=-0.012 y.max=0.00 z.min=3.5 z.max=4</b> <p>
After the device description, the
<b> model </b> statement is used to select a set of physical models for this simulation.  In this case,
these models are &apos;consrh&apos; and &apos;auger&apos; recombination, the conmob and fldmob mobility models,
Band Gap Narrowing.
The
<b> impact </b> statement is used to specify the Selberherr model.
The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to assign the work function on the polysilicon gate.
</p>
<p>
The numerical methods used are also similar to the previous example:
<b> METHOD gummel newton carr=2</b> . This means that if convergence is not reached in decoupled mode (gummel)
the simulator will automatically switch to coupled mode (newton). In
addition, a two carrier solution is performed by solving Poisson&apos;s
equation for potential and the electron and hole continuity equations.
</p>
<p>
The drain voltage is set to 0.1V, and then the gate voltage is swept
to 1.5V to measure the Ids/Vgs curve.
</p>
<p>
Then the gate voltage is set to 1.5V, and then the drain voltage is
swept to 3V.  At this point, faster solutions are obtained using the
coupled newton algorithm so the simulation switches to this
method.  The drain voltage is then ramped to 4V.
</p>

The IV results are displayed using TonyPlot.
