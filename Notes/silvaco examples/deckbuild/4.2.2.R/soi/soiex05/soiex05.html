This example compares the results of Ids/Vds curves for an SOI
transistor using isothermal and non-isothermal approaches. The heating
of the silicon film causes a negative saturation slope. The file shows:

</ul>
<p>
There are two Atlas runs in this example file. The first uses lattice
heating and the second uses isothermal models.
</p>
<p>
The initial phase of the input file constructs an SOI device using the Atlas syntax.
<b> mesh, region </b> and
<b> electrode </b> statements are used to define the geometry and mesh of the structure. The
<b> doping </b> statement is used to define analytical doping profiles. A uniformly
p-doped silicon film is used with heavy gaussian n+ source and drain
regions.
</p>
<p>
The heat flow equation is selected using
<b> models lat.temp</b> . Other models such as
<b> arora </b> are used to define a temperature dependent mobility model. Local
lattice temperature is used in the documented mobility model
equations. The thermal boundary conditions are crucial in simulations with
lattice heating. The
<b> thermcontact </b> statement defines the heat sink. The heat sink is on the bottom of the silicon substrate region. All other boundaries are presumed to be in thermal isolation.
</p>
<p>
The choice of numerical method in SOI device simulation is also
important. The standard newton method has some convergence problems in
floating body devices. As impact ionization occurs the initial guess to
the potential of the floating channel region becomes more difficult.
The newton method, which relies on a good initial guess, can encounter
convergence difficulties. These difficulties are generally not fatal to
the simulation, but require small voltage steps to be used. This adds
to the CPU time considerably. A more robust method available in Atlas
is by choosing the combined gummel/newton algorithm.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the solution of the heat flow equation must also be
included. The most robust method, once the temperature rises above the
heat sink level, is newton. However in the early stages of the solution
the decoupled
<b> block </b> method is better. Atlas can switch between these methods so all are included in the
<b> method gummel block newton </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The electrical solutions for Ids/Vds is defined in a similar manner to
the regular NMOS example described in the MOS examples section.
</p>
<p>
The simulation with lattice heat is exactly analogous to the subsequent
one using isothermal models. The run differs only in having no lat.temp
or thermcontact definition.
</p>
<p>
Id/Vds curves form the two runs can be overlaid in TonyPlot showing
the effect of lattice heating on the device performance. The increased
temperature causes the mobility to decrease as the drain bias rises
leading to a negative saturation slope. Comparison of the physical
variables at the same bias is also possible from the saved solution
files. Plotting impact ionization in each case shows how the elevated
lattice temperature reduces the impact ionization rate.
