This example uses process simulation to construct a
<b> SOI MOSFET</b> that has full dielectric isolation. Device simulations are then
performed that use Non-isothermal Energy Balance (NEB) calculations
to obtain Ids/Vds characteristics.
It shows:

A silicon-oxide-silicon structure was formed in SSuprem 4 by use of the
<b> region</b> statement of Athena. This structure was then subjected to a standard bulk
MOSFET processing sequence, which has been described in mos1ex01.in.
The structure in this example has been designed so that the SOI thickness
is greater than the depth of the source and drain junctions.
This ensures that the device will operate in a partially depleted mode of
operation during later device simulations.
</p>
<p>
One major modification made to the original processing sequence was to
introduce a LOCOS isolation step. The result of this step was the creation
of a fully oxide isolated island of silicon. The
<b> COMPRESS </b> model for oxidation has been used in this example but more complex and
accurate models may be used to study birds beak effects in SOI MOSFETs,
as described in the Athena/SSuprem 4 section.
</p>
<p>
The process simulation structure will be passed into Atlas automatically
using DeckBuild&apos;s auto-interface. This auto-interface therefore
allows global optimization from process simulation to device simulation
to SPICE model parameter extraction.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> contact </b> statement is used in Atlas to define the workfunction of the gate electrode. The
<b> interface  </b> command is used to define the the fixed charge at the oxide/silicon interfaces. The
<b> models </b> statement defines a set of physical models for the simulation. CVT and SRH are
standard models for MOSFET simulation. The energy balance equation for electrons
is specified by
<b> hcte.el </b> parameter and the lattice heat flow equation is solved with Giga by setting the parameter
<b> lat.temp</b> . A thermal contact must also be defined when solving the heat flow equation with
Giga and is defined using the
<b> thermcontact </b> statement. In this example this thermal electrode is defined to be the same as
contact number #4 which is the substrate electrode.
</p>
<p>
The numerical algorithm chosen for this system of equations is the newton approach
defined on the
<b> method </b> statement. This statement is also used to define the semiconductor equations.
<b> carr=2 </b> will solve for potential and the hole and electron continuity equations. The
<b> trap </b> parameter allows the bias step to be reduced in cases of non-convergence for a total of
<b> maxtrap</b> times.
</p>
<p>
The solution begins by applying zero volts to all contacts and only solving for potential.
A small voltage is then applied to the drain contact. This is normally advised in the
case of SOI simulations due to the presence of a floating region of potential.
As described in previous SOI examples, this floating region of potential can cause
great numerical difficulties. However by solving for 5 equations, which couples
the equations very tightly, and applying only small voltage steps the convergence
in this example is excellent.
</p>
<p>
The gate voltage is ramped to 1, 2 and 3 V and a solution saved at each of these
bias conditions.  Each solution is then used as the initial starting point for
simulating the Ids/Vds characteristics by using the
<b> load</b> command. A logfile is then opened to store the terminal characteristics and a
<b> solve </b> statement applies the drain bias sweep. This procedure is then repeated for each gate voltage.
