This example is similar to the previous
<b> soiex11.in</b> example, except that it aims at pointing a simple way to generate a 2D 20nm FDSOI NMOSFET from the existing 3D process flow in the previous
<b> soiex11.in</b> example.
</p>
<p>
When a mask layout file is used for process simulation, a 2D simulation deck in Victory Process differs from a 3D simulation deck only in that a 2D simulation domain (2D cut) must be defined within the mask using the
<b> FROM </b> and
<b> TO </b> parameters as well as the
<b> AT </b> parameter of the
<b> INIT</b> statement. In this example, a 2D cut is made at the position Y = 0.02
<b> (AT=0.02)</b> within the
<b> soiex12.lay</b> mask, which is idential to the
<b> soiex11.lay</b> mask used in the previous
<b> soiex11.in</b> example, to create a 2D FDSOI NMOS structure. The cut line is parallel to the X-axis starting from the point X = 0
<b> (FROM=0)</b> , which coincides with the left side of the mask area, to the point X = 0.12
<b> (TO=0.12)</b> , which coincides with the right side of the mask area. As this X cut-line at the Y = 0.02 position within the mask results in a 2D simulation in XZ plane, the
<b> FLOW.DIM=2D_XZ</b> parameter is also specified in the
<b> INIT</b> statement to enforce the 2D symmetry mode right from the beginning of the simulation flow.
</p>
<p>
The resulting 2D FDSOI NMOSFET is meshed using Victory Process.  In addition, the maximum level of obtuseness
of a triangle in the device mesh is set to
<b> MAX.OBTUSENESS=1.</b> The lower the value of
<b> MAX.OBTUSENESS,</b> the more triangles of the resulting conformal device mesh are less obtuse.
</p>
<p>
Like the previous
<b> soiex11.in</b> example, the Id-Vd characteristics of the 2D 20nm FD-SOI MOSFET are simulated with various carrier transport models using Victory Device.
