This example repeats soiex01.in but for a device that has been designed to operate with a fully depleted SOI film.  It demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Basic SOI structure definition using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting transport models including impact ionization
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Generating an Id/Vgs curve with Vds=0.1V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Extracting threshold voltage and subthreshold slope from the results
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Plotting output curves and structures
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Thin film fully depleted SOI MOSFETs have been shown to achieve low threshold voltages and near ideal inverse subthreshold slopes. This makes them ideal for low power operation.
This example demonstrates that Atlas is capable of reproducing the differences between a partially depleted transistor in soiex01.in and the fully depleted transistor in this example.
</p>
<p>
The syntax and methodology used within this example are identical to that of soiex01.in with only two three modifications.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> mesh </b> has been modified to support the thinner SOI film thickness of 0.1um and the definition of the SOI layers on the
<b> region </b> statement has similarly been adapted. Also, the channel doping has been reduced on the
<b> doping </b> statement to ensure the film is fully depleted.
