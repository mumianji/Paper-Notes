This example demonstrates an Id/Vds 3D analysis of a short channel
ultra-thin SOI transistor with a body contact. Two simulations are
performed with and without lattice heating turned on.
</p>
<p>
Such simulations cannot be performed accurately using a 2D simulator
because the body electrode is located in a different z-plane compared with the drain, gate and source. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Formation of 3D structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vds solution with Vgs=3.0V
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The formation of this 3D structure is performed using the Atlas syntax.
The syntax used is very similar to that of a 2D example. The
definition of dimensions in the third direction is defined by the
<b> z </b> indicator. Thus z.min and z.max define extents in the z direction, just
as x.min and x.max do in the x direction.
</p>
<p>
The SOI device is composed of a 0.2 micron layer of silicon on a 0.4
micron silicon dioxide substrate.  The device has a 17 nm thick gate
oxide and a gate length of 1.0 microns (effective channel length is 0.8
microns).  The gate width is 2.5um. The body contact location is
defined by the following statement
</p>
<b> electrode     name=body   x.min=1 x.max=2 y.min=0.0 y.max=0.0 z.min=3.5 z.max=4</b> <p>
The
<b> model </b> statement is used after the device description to select a set of physical
models for this simulation. In this case the example uses conmob: the
doping dependent low field mobility model, fldmob: the lateral electric
field-dependent mobility model, srh: Shockley-Read-Hall recombination,
auger: recombination
accounting for high level injection effects, and bgn: band gap narrowing.
</p>
<p>
Also, in the lattice heating simulation input deck, an additional parameter
<b> lat.temp</b> is placed on the
<b> model</b> statement. This switches on lattice heating inside the simulation. With
this option it is also necessary to include a thermal boundary condition.
This is included using the following statement:
</p>
<b> thermcontact num=1 ext.temp=300 x.min=0 x.max=3 y.min=0.35 z.min=0 z.max=4  </b> <p>
and forces the temperature on the bottom of the device to be fixed at 300K.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> impact </b> statement is used to specify Selberherr model.
The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to assign the work function on the polysilicon gate.
</p>
<p>
The numerical methods used are different to previous 2D examples and are
chosen by the statement
<b> method       bicgst.</b> This chooses a bi-conjugate gradient solution scheme which has been found
to give robust and fast simulations of three dimensional devices.
</p>
<p>
The drain voltage is set to 0.1V, and then the gate voltage is swept to
3.0V to obtain the operating gate voltage.
</p>
<p>
Then the gate voltage is set to 3.0V, and then the drain voltage is
swept to its final value.
</p>
<p>
The IV results are displayed using TonyPlot showing the ID-VG characteristics
both with and without lattice heating.
