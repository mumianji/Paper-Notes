This example shows how the general purpose OPTIMIZER can be used for
extraction of dual-Pearson implant parameters from an experimental
profile. This technique could be useful when Athena&apos;s implant look-up
tables do not include moments for a specific implant (e.g. 0 degrees angle,
very high or low energy, &quot;exotic&quot; ion-material combination, etc.) or
when it appears that a simulated profile does not match an experimental one.
This example can also be used as a tutorial for setting up an optimization
procedure with a so-called curved target.
</p>
<p>
An experimental profile for 1e13 ion/cm**2, 15 keV, 0 degrees Boron implant
into &lt;100&gt; crystalline silicon is used in this example. This SIMS profile
published by H. Kinoshita of the Microelectronic Research Center (Austin, TX).
The profile is in a simple XY format which can be read into the OPTIMIZER
<b> ancaex08_4256.opt</b> .
</p>
<p>
To load and execute this example, display this text and select the
<b> Load example </b> button while this text is displayed. This will copy the input file and several support
files including ancaex08_4256.dat and ancaex08_4256.opt will be copied
to your current working directory at this time.
</p>
<p>
Selection of initial values for optimization is usually very important
in the setup of the optimization task. In thr case of implantation one can use
parameters available for a similar implant. To demonstrate the flexibility
of this approach, parameters corresponding to the same implant but at
7 degrees are used. It can be performed by using default a SVDP model and
PRINT.MOM parameter in the IMPLANT statement.
</p>
<p>
If you want to compare this initial approximation with the experimental one,
just  select the
<b> run </b> button to execute the example. In the end the two profiles will be
overlaid in TonyPlot, so one can see that the experimental profile
has a much bigger and deeper channeling peak than the default 7 degrees
profile.
</p>
<p>
The Optmizer is used to find a better set of dual-Pearson parameters
<b> range, std.dev, gamma, </b> etc. that will result in a simulated profile which better match the experimental one.
In order to achieve this, select
<b> Optimizer... </b> from the
<b> Main Control </b> menu. The
<b> Deckbuild: Optimizer </b> screen will appear in a moment. Unlike the first example ancaex08.in, this example
does not use a special optimizer file with preset parameters and targets,
so you should repeat the following steps in order to set the optimization task.
</p>
<p>
First, select
<b> Parameters </b> from the
<b> Mode </b> menu, this will display the Parameter worksheet. Select (highlight) the
MOMENTS statement and choose
<b> Add </b> from the
<b> Edit </b> pull-down menu. The
<b> Parameter define </b> pop-up will appear. Check all check-boxes excluding the first two which
correspond to dose and energy, then press
<b> Apply</b> .
Nine new rows will be inserted into the Parameter worksheet.  By
default all min/max values for parameters are +-50%. This should be
changed for some parameters. For example, we may expect a wider range
for skewness (asymmetry) for Pearson distributions, therefore we set
<br/>
{bold} Minimum value
to -1.0
and
<b> Maximum value </b> to +3.0 for
<b> gamma </b> and
<b> sgamma </b> parameters.
Also, the intervals for the fourth moment
<b> kurtosis </b> of both first and second Pearson functions should be wider (2.7,10.0).
<b> dratio </b> should not be higher than 1.0 therefore its maximum value should be set
to 1.0. To edit any of these numeric values position the pointer over
the corresponding cell of the worksheet, click the left-hand mouse
button, edit the value, and do not forget to push the return button
after finishing the editing.
</p>
<p>
The next step is setting the curved target. Select
<b> Targets </b> from the
<b> Mode </b> menu. Highlight the
<b> extract </b> line. This line extracts the Boron chemical concentration profile which
corresponds to the SIMS measured profile. After that choose
<b> Add </b> from the
<b> Edit </b> pull-down menu. A new row will be inserted into the Target worksheet.
The target name will correspond to the name in the extract statement.
Now, to insert experimental profiles as a curved target select the only
row in the worksheet by double-clicking the left-hand button while the
pointer is positioned anywhere in the row, then choose
<b> Edit &gt; X/Y Data &gt; Insert &gt; From File</b> . The
<b> Optimizer X/Y Target Data </b> pop-up will appear. Select
<b> ancaex08_4256.opt </b> file and then press
<b> Load</b> .
</p>
<p>
The next step is to change the response type of the curved target from
<b> log </b> to
<b> linear</b> .
Otherwise the estimated error would be very small because Optimizer
would take the log of the result and target at each point before
computing the error. Select the
<b> Edit &gt; Select all</b> . All the rows will appear raised. Then choose
<b> Lin/Log</b> from the same menu and all row&apos;s response type will be toggled.
</p>
<p>
Now, once the parameters, targets, and setup information have been
defined, the Optimization process can be started by pressing the
<b> Optimize </b> button. During the optimization run, the
<b> Graphics </b> mode shows real-time updates of parameter, target, and error values.
After optimization is completed you may execute
<b> TonyPlot </b> which will plot the comparison between optimized and measured profiles.
