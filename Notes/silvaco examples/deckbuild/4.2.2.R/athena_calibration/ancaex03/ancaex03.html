<p>
This example performs calibration of thin oxide model parameters using
OPTIMIZER. These parameters are quite accurately characterized for dryo2
ambient, but virtually no information exists for wetO2 ambient. Historically,
wet oxidation has been predominantly used for thick oxide growth. However,
low temperature, low pressure, short time wet oxidation is becoming more
popular. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge extensive experimental
results do not exist for such oxidations. Therefore, calibration based just
on few experimental points may need to be performed for wet thin oxidations.
</p>
<p>
The default value for thin oxidation term for wetO2 is zero. This
usually underestimates thin oxide thickness. The default values result
in 71 A and 173 A oxide thicknesses for 30 and 90 minutes wetO2
oxidation at 820 C and pressure of 0.2 atmospheres. Typical
experimental values could be 100 A and 230 A.  These values
are selected as targets for calibration procedure.  Only using
OPTIMIZER could the parameters of thin oxidation models be found.

To load and execute this example, select the
<b> Load example </b> button. Once loaded, select
<b> Optimizer... </b> from the
<b> Main Control </b> menu. The
<b> Deckbuild: Optimizer </b> screen will appear. Select
<b> Load File ... </b> from the
<b> File </b> menu and then load the special optimizer file
<b> ancaex03.opt </b> from the scrolling
<b> Optimizer Load </b> menu.
</p>
<p>
Preset parameters and targets are included in this file. When you
select
<b> Parameters </b> from the
<b> Mode </b> menu you will find that thinox.0 and thinox.l are chosen as parameters for optimization. The default values for dryo2 oxidation are selected as an initial
guess.
</p>
<p>
Oxide thicknesses
<b> tox1 </b> and
<b> tox2 </b> after 30 and 90 minutes of oxidation respectively are selected as a targets.
</p>
<p>
You can modify any of these targets and/or parameters. Please refer to
Chapter
<b> Optimizer </b> in the VWF Interactive Tools Manual.
</p>
<p>
If you want to run the preset optimization
task, it is better to slightly improve the default stop criteria as follows:
</p>
<p>
Select
<b> Setup </b> from the
<b> Mode </b> menu. Then decrease the maximum error down to 2, and increase the number of Iterations to 10.
</p>
<p>
After this just select the
<b> Optimize </b> button, on the OPTIMIZER menu.
