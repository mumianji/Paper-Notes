This example performs optimization of implant doses and energies as well as
diffusion temperature in order to obtain a specified boron doping profile as
well as pn-junction depth.
The target boron profile is a constant doping with concentration of 2e16
all the way from the silicon surface until x=1.0. The target for the pn-junction
depth is 1.5 micron.
</p>
<p>
To load and execute this example, select the
<b> Load </b> button.
</p>
<p>
First, run the example without optimization. From, the
<b> TonyPlot </b> profile you will see that boron concentration varies between 2e16 and 5e16
and the pn-junction is around 1.3 microns.
</p>
<p>
In order to find an optimized solution select
<b> Optimizer... </b> from the
<b> Main Control </b> menu. The
<b> Deckbuild: Optimizer </b> screen will appear in a moment. Select
<b> Load File ... </b> from the
<b> File </b> menu and then load the special optimizer file
<b> ancaex07.in.opt </b> from the scrolling
<b> Optimizer Load </b> menu.
</p>
<p>
Preset parameters and targets are included in this file. When you
select
<b> Parameters </b> from the
<b> Mode </b> menu you will find that doses and energies for all 4 implants as well as diffusion
temperature are chosen as parameters for optimization.
</p>
<p>
Boron profile
<b> bcurve </b> is chosen as an optimization target. Constant concentrations of 2e16 are set as target
values for depths from 0.02 to 1 micron. Then a concentration of 1e16
is set for 1.1 micron. Weights for all these points are set to 1.0. A junction depth of 1.5 microns is
an additional point target with a weight of 6.0.
</p>
<p>
Now you can modify any of these targets and/or parameters. Please refer to
Chapter
<b> Optimizer </b> in the VWF Interactive Tools Manual.
</p>
<p>
If you want to run the preset optimization
task it is better to slightly relax the default stop criteria as follows:
</p>
<p>
Select
<b> Setup </b> from the
<b> Mode </b> menu and increase the maximum error to 20.
</p>
<p>
After this just select the
<b> Optimize </b> button.
</p>
<p>
After optimization is completed you may execute the
<b> TonyPlot </b> which will the plot final optimized profile.
After optimization is completed you may copy optimized parameters back to the input deck
by selecting
<b> Copy to Deck </b> from the
<b> Edit </b> menu. After that you can run the optimized deck from the beginning and obtain a
<b> Tonyplot </b> of the optimized profile.
