This example demonstrates postprocessing on CCD structures from the
previous examples. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Extraction of the line of
maximum potential from a 2D structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 2D integration of a charge packet
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first section of the example takes a solution file from the transient
charge transfer in the first example in this section. It uses the extract
feature
<b> max.conc.file </b> to store a file of the maximum potential for each x location in the
structure. This file can be plotted directly in TonyPlot. Alternatively,
the file can be overlayed onto the 2D structure in TonyPlot. This can
be performed by plotting the 2D CCD structure with the flag
<b> -ccd</b> .  To overlay the file saved by extract, right mouse click on the main
TonyPlot window and choose &quot;Maximum Potential&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The second and third extract statements use the 2D integration feature of
<b> extract </b> to give the integrated electron concentration in the charge packet.
This is done for both empty and full well conditions.
