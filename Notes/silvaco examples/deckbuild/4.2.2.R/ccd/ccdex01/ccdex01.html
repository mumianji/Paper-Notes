In this example a CCD structure is constructed using the Athena process
simulator. This structure is passed to Atlas for electrical testing.
The input file tests consist of four portions:
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of a CCD device
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Emptying the storage well of carriers
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Illuminating the CCD with a light source and measuring the generated carriers
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Transfer of the carriers to the drain
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first stage of the input constructs the CCD geometry and doping
profiles in Athena. The CCD device consists of a storage node on the
left of the structure controlled by a polysilicon gate. A transfer node
to the right of this is also controlled by both a polysilicon gate and a drain
region of heavy n+ doping with a metal contact.
</p>
<p>
The CCD structure has an n- active region at the surface above a p-type
substrate. Under the transfer node an extra p-type implant is given.
This implant is of sufficient magnitude to create a potential
difference between the storage and transfer nodes, but is not so large
as to cause a junction.
</p>
<p>
The process simulation is designed to run extremely quickly so there is
a minimum of diffusion steps included. The final stages of the Athena
input performs the electrode definition needed by Atlas.  Also some
EXTRACT statements are used to measure the junction depth of the active
region under the storage and transfer nodes.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas simulation begins with definition of the models and material
parameters of the device.  The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to define the
workfunction of the two polysilicon electrodes.  The
<b> material </b> statement
is used to define minority carrier lifetimes in the semiconductor.  The
interface charge between the gate oxide and the semiconductor is set by
the &apos;qf&apos; parameter of the
<b> interface </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The physical models used in this simulation reflect different
physical effects that are important in CCD devices. The mobility model CVT
includes a surface mobility degradation  which is important in the
transfer phase of the simulation as the charge moves from the storage
node to the drain. The recombination models consrh and auger are needed
as the recombination of the carriers is important in determining the
capacity and charge transfer characteristics. Band gap narrowing is
also needed to model the properties of areas with high carrier concentration.
</p>
<p>
The initial part of the Atlas input file biases the drain to +20V,
whilst the two gates are held at -6V. This is done to deplete the electrons
from the n- active layer. The final structure with the active layer
empty of carriers is saved. At this point
<b> extract </b> statements are used
to extract the integrated electron concentration in the storage well.
This will be a small number.
</p>
<p>
Next, Luminous is used to illuminate the storage node. The light beam is
defined near the start of the input file using the
<b> beam </b> statement. This
beam is defined with a 500nm wavelength, an origin at (0,-1) and width of
2um. The angle of 90 degrees specifies normal incidence onto the top of
the CCD. Luminous calculates all internal reflections and absorption by
the layers within the simulation structure.
</p>
<p>
To illuminate the structure, a transient simulation is used. The power of the
light beam is controlled by the parameter B1 on the SOLVE statement.
This is defined to rise from zero to 1 W/cm^2 in 5ns, to remain at this
power for a further 15ns, and then to fall to zero in another 5ns.  The
<b> tstep </b> parameter is used to define the initial timestep of the
simulation. All other timesteps are automatically calculated by Atlas
based on the local truncation error. The
<b> tstop </b> parameter defines the
end of the simulation time. The illumination part is set to last 50ns.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the illumination section a structure is stored. This
structure can be plotted to see the charge collected under the storage
node. The potential difference between the storage and transfer nodes
created by the extra boron implant stops charge from leaking away to
the large positive potential on the drain.
<b> extract </b> statements are used
once again to measure the integrated electron concentration. The value
obtained is subtracted from the value obtained from the empty well.
</p>
<p>
The final stage of the Atlas simulation is the charge transfer. This is
also performed as a transient simulation. It is very important to note
that during a single Atlas run the time is
<i> not</i> reset to zero. Since the
illumination section was 50ns, that is the starting time for this
section. In this section the transfer gate is ramped from -6V to +2V.
This causes the potential barrier between the storage node and the
drain to be removed, Charge can now flow form the storage node, under the
transfer gate and into the drain.
</p>
<p>
At each timestep in the transfer simulation a structure is saved.
By loading several of these structure files into TonyPlot it is possible
to observe the movement of charge across the device.
