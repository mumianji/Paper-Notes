In this example a CCD structure is constructed using the Athena process
simulator. This structure is passed to Atlas for electrical testing.
The input file tests consist of three portions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of a CCD device
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Emptying the storage well of carriers by directly setting the quasi-fermi levels
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Illuminating the CCD with a light source and measuring the generated carriers
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example differs from the previous one in that
<b> no drain contact is used</b> . The emptying of the well is performed by setting the quasi-fermi level
of the n- active region directly.
</p>
<p>
The structure of this CCD is two polysilicon gates on top of silicon
separated by a nitride/oxide insulator layer. The right hand gate will
be used to collect the charge and the left hand gate will confine this
charge under the right-hand gate.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the input file is the Athena process to produce the
structure as described for the previous example. Electrodes are defined
in  Athena and the
<b> extract </b> statement is used to measure the junction depth of the n- active
layer.
</p>
<p>
In the Atlas simulation the material and models definition is similar
to the previous example. The CVT surface transport model is not needed
as this simulation does not include charge transfer.
</p>
<p>
The key technique demonstrated by this example is the use of setting
the quasi fermi levels directly in Atlas. To set the quasi fermi levels
for electrons the parameter
<b> n.bias </b> is used. For this to work,
it is necessary to use a zero carrier solution. The
setting of
<b> method carriers=0 </b> specifies a zero carrier solution, and only Poisson&apos;s
equation for potential is solved.
</p>
<p>
Using &apos;n.bias&apos; the electron quasi fermi level is set to +20V. This is a
non equilibrium condition so the only way to use the solution of the
continuity equations is to observe the electron concentration is in
transient mode. Atlas is switched to solve for electron and holes using
<b> method carriers=2</b> . A short transient simulation then is performed and a
structure file is saved. Plotting electron concentration in this structure
file shows the CCD storage well to be depleted of electrons. An
<b> extract </b> statement is used to quantify this.
</p>
<p>
In this CCD biasing scheme the storage node to the left is biased to
+12V and the containment node to the left is biased at -8V. This
ensures that charges generated under the storage gate are collected
there.
</p>
<p>
In the final stage of the input file the CCD storage node is
illuminated.  The light beam is defined in the BEAM statement to be
normally incident from the top, with an origin of (6.85,-1), width 4um
and wavelength 800nm. All reflections, refraction and absorption in the
layers of the structure are simulated by Atlas.
</p>
<p>
A transient illumination is defined lasting 1us. At the end of this
time the amount of electrons trapped in the CCD can be measured using
the
<b> extract </b> statement.
