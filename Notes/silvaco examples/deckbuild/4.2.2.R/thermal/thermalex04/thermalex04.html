This example runs thermal simulation of a  GaAs IC structure with three
heat producing devices.
</p>
<p>
The device consists of three GaAs regions defined as heat sources in a
GaAs substrate. A single thermal contact is applied to the bottom of
the substrate region. The structure is prepared using DevEdit 3D in a
similar manner to the previous examples in this section.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas, the
<b> material </b> statement is used to define the power output of two of the three GaAs
regions. The substrate is defined as having a temperature dependent
thermal conductivity according to the
<b> tcon.power </b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
This example is designed to show the effect of the heating produced by
neighboring devices on a non-heat producing transistor. The third GaAs
region (defined as region #4) has no heat power output. However the
solution file will show that the device is heated by conduction from
the neighboring devices.
