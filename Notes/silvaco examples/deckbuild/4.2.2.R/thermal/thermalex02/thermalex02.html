This example runs a thermal simulation of a 2 layer structure with 8 power
sources. The main sequential tasks are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Specification of all ten regions in DevEdit 3D
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of heat sink in in DevEdit 3D
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface to Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of thermal models and material parameters
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Solving of temperature distribution
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example is similar to the device described in
<b> Thermal Simulation and Design of a GaAs HBT Sample and Hold Circuit </b> by Ken Poulton et al. The device technology is from the paper by R.
Nubling in Technical Digest of 1990 GaAs IC Symposium pp53-56.
</p>
<p>
The structure in this example is defined using DevEdit 3D in a similar
manner to the previous example. Initially the structure was defined
using the graphical mode of DevEdit 3D. After the mesh was created, a
command file was saved from DevEdit 3D enabling the structure to be
re-created in DeckBuild.
</p>
<p>
Once in Atlas, the
<b> models thermal </b> statement is used to indicate that this is a heat distribution simulation.
The
<b> material </b> statement is used to set the heat power output of each of the eight
heat producing regions in this structure. Region #10 is defined to have
a constant thermal conductivity of 1.0. The
<b> solve t1=300 </b> statement sets the thermal boundary condition on the electrode to be
300K and then solves the heat flow equation self-consistently in the
structure. The resulting 3D heat distribution can be shown in
TonyPlot 3D.
