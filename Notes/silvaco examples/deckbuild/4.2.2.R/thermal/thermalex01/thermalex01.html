This example runs thermal simulation of a 2 transistors. The main sequential tasks are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Specification of two neighboring transistor regions in DevEdit 3D
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of heat sinks in in DevEdit 3D
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface to Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of thermal models and material parameters
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Solution of temperature distribution
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The structure in this example is defined using DevEdit 3D. The structure was
initially defined using the graphical mode of DevEdit 3D. After the mesh was
created, a command file was saved from DevEdit 3D enabling the structure to
be re-created in DeckBuild.
</p>
<p>
The structure used here consists of two neighboring transistors
embedded in a substrate material. For thermal modeling, the transistors
are considered only as heat sources. No internal details of the
transistors are considered. An Aluminum region is defined as an
<b> electrode</b> on the bottom of the substrate material. This will act in
Atlas as a thermal rather than an electrical boundary condition.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> go atlas </b> statement automatically interfaces DevEdit 3D to Atlas. On reading the
three dimensional mesh file, Atlas will automatically enter 3D mode.
</p>
<p>
The material statement is used to define the thermal conductivities of each region using the
<b> tc.const </b> parameter. This parameter sets a constant value for thermal
conductivity. Later examples show regions with temperature dependent
thermal conductivities. The
<b> power </b> parameter sets the thermal output of the region. This naturally defines these regions at heat sources.
</p>
<p>
The command
<b> models thermal </b> is all that is required to enable the 3D thermal calculations. The final stage sets
<b> solve t1=300</b> . This defines the temperature of the heat sink (or electrode) number 1. The final 3D thermal distribution is saved to the file specified by the
<b> outfile</b> parameter. This can be viewed in TonyPlot 3D.
