This example runs thermal simulation of a 2 transistors. The main sequential tasks are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Specification of two neighboring transistor regions in DevEdit 3D
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of heat sinks in in DevEdit 3D
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface to Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of thermal models and material parameters
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of the power stepping parameters
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Solution of temperature distribution at different thermal powers
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The structure in this example is defined using DevEdit 3D. Initially
the structure was defined using the graphical mode of DevEdit 3D. After
the mesh was created, a command file was saved from DevEdit 3D enabling the
structure to be re-created in DeckBuild.
</p>
<p>
The structure used here consists of two neighboring transistors
embedded in a substrate material. For thermal modeling the transistors
are considered only as heat sources. No internal details of the
transistors are considered. An Aluminum region is defined as an
<b> electrode </b> on the bottom of the substrate material. This will act in
Atlas as a thermal rather than an electrical boundary condition.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> go atlas </b> statement automatically interfaces DevEdit 3D to Atlas. On reading the
three dimensional mesh file, Atlas will automatically enter 3D mode.
</p>
<p>
The material statement is used to define the thermal conductivities of each region using the
<b> tc.const </b> parameter. This parameter sets a constant value for thermal
conductivity. Later examples show regions with temperature dependent
thermal conductivities. The
<b> power </b> parameter sets the thermal output of the region. This naturally defines these regions at heat sources.  The region thermal power can also be defined in the
<b> solve </b> statement for power stepping as shown below.
</p>
<p>
The command
<b> models thermal </b> is all that is required to enable the 3D thermal calculations. The final stage sets
<b> solve t1=300</b> . This defines the temperature of the heat sink (or electrode) number 1.
The region thermal power can be specified by adding the
<b> POWERx</b> parameter where
<b> x</b> is the region number.  This has the same effect as in the
<b> material</b> statement and will override the value if already set.  In this example the thermal power of region 2 is stepped by adding the
<b> POWERSTEP NSTEPS </b> and
<b> STEPREGION </b> parameters.
</p>
<b> POWER2 </b> <p>
defines the initial thermal power for region #2.
<b> POWERSTEP </b> determines the size of the power step,
<b> NSTEPS </b> sets the number of power steps to be performed and the
<b> STEPREGION </b> option determines which region to step as the thermal power of any region may be specified on the
<b> solve </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The final 3D thermal distribution is saved to the file specified by the
<b> outfile </b> parameter. The output file name rightmost characters will be incremented alphanumerically so a different file will be saved for each step. These can be viewed in TonyPlot 3D.
