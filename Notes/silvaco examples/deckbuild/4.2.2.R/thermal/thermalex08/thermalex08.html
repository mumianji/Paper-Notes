<p>
When a wafer is clamped only at it edges and is heated with an infra-red
source in a vacuum, the majority of the heat loss occurs through
<b> black body radiation.</b> The vacuum prevents thermal conduction mechanisms for the majority of the
wafer area.  It is also important to realize that if both sides of the wafer
are exposed to the vacuum without contact to a conductive heat sink, both the
front and back sides of the wafer will radiate heat and so black body heat
radiation must be simulated from both surfaces for accurate results.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas, black body radiation is simulated with an additional logical
parameter,
<b> &quot;BLACKBODY&quot;</b> added to the
<b> &quot;THERMCONTACT&quot;</b> statement.  This allows the user to set up multiple thermally radiative
boundary conditions in their structure.
</p>
<p>
The power per unit area lost to black body radiation for an ideal radiator,
is known absolutely for any given temperature, K.  The power absorbed by
that same body from it&apos;s surroundings, is also known absolutely from the
temperature of those surroundings.  The nett power loss or gain, to or
from, any body by infra-red radiation, is therefore simply the difference
between the power lost to it&apos;s surrounds and the power absorbed from it&apos;s
surroundings.
</p>
<p>
The formula in Atlas is given by:
</p>
<b> { ALPHA (T - EXT.TEMP) }  +  { STEFAN ( T^4 - EXT.TEMP^4) }  W/cm^2</b> <p>
Where:-
</p>
<b> &quot;ALPHA&quot;</b> <p>
is the coefficient to take account of thermal conductivity to
the wafer holder, and should be set to zero if all the heat loss is
through radiative processes only,
</p>
<b> &quot;T&quot;</b> <p>
is the temperature of the surface calculated by Atlas,
</p>
<b> &quot;EXT.TEMP&quot;</b> <p>
is the external temperature of the surroundings,
usually 300K if the equipment in normal laboratory conditions,
</p>
<b> &quot;STEFAN&quot;</b> <p>
is the black body radiation constant.
</p>
<p>
For reflective surfaces, the
<b> surface emissivity</b> correction can be taken account of by reducing the value of the
<b> &quot;STEFAN&quot; </b> parameter from the ideal black body radiation value of
5.67051x10^-12 W/cm2/K^4, which is the default value.  The area of the
thermal contact is also calculated by Atlas by integration of the area
of all mesh points in contact with the user defined thermal contact.
</p>
<p>
So in summary, for an ideal black body radiator, only the background
temperature
<b> &quot;EXT.TEMP&quot; </b> need be specified on the
<b> &quot;THERMCONTACT&quot; </b> statement,the rest will be calculated by Atlas.  For reflective surfaces,
with less than ideal radiation characteristics, the
<b> effective emissivity coefficient </b> can be taken account of by using the appropriate value of the
<b> &quot;STEFAN&quot;</b> parameter.  Simply multiply the default value of &quot;STEFAN&quot; by the
emissivity coefficient.  For pure radiative cooling, also set the thermal
conductivity coefficient,
<b> &quot;ALPHA&quot; </b> to zero.
