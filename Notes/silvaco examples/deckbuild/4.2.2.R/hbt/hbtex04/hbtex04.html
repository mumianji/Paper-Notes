This example compares the results of Ic/Vce simulation of an
AlGaAs/GaAs HBT using the Energy Balance (EB) and Nonisothermal Energy
Balance (NEB) Models.
It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Graded heterojunction AlGaAs/GaAs HBT formation using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of energy balance models
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Solution for Ic/Vce characteristics
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Comparative simulation including lattice heat flow 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Deep GaAs submicron devices should be simulated using the energy balance
Model due to strong velocity overshoot, which may substantially
influence device characteristics. For high current levels, the thermal
self-heating effects may also play an important role due to the
relatively small heat conductivity in GaAs, thereby decreasing mobility and
leading to a negative output conductance. This example demonstrates a
comparison of Ic-Vce curves obtained with Energy Balance and
Nonisothermal Energy Balance Models.
</p>
<p>
Two Atlas runs are included in this example. The initial stages of each
uses Atlas syntax to specify a graded heterojunction HBT. The syntax
used is similar to the AlGaAs/GaAs HBT examples described before. The
first run proceeds to select and solve self-consistently the classical
equations: Poisson&apos;s equation and the two carrier continuity equations,
and the energy balance equation for electrons. The second run adds the
lattice heat flow equation to these four and solves self-consistently
using a coupled solver.
</p>
<p>
The energy balance model is selected by
<b> models hcte.el</b> . The most important parameter in energy balance simulation are the
relaxation times. These are set on the
<b> material</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
In each run the base bias is ramped to 1.2V. Then
<b> contact num=2 current</b> is used to set current boundary conditions
on the base electrode.  The base current is forced to a value of
15uA/um. After this the collector voltage is ramped to 2.0V to obtain
the Ic/Vce curve.
</p>
<p>
The same set of models is used, except that the solution of the  lattice energy
balance equation is activated using the syntax
<b> models lat.temp</b> . For the AlGaAs region the temperature dependence of the low field
mobilities is set by the
<b> tmup</b> and
<b> tmun</b> parameters on the
<b> material</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
As with all non-isothermal simulation, thermal boundary conditions must
be included.  These are defined in the
<b> thermcontact </b> statement.
A value of the thermal resistance is specified at the thermal contact
located along the substrate, and thermal isolation conditions are
assumed on the all other surfaces.
</p>
<p>
The results of the two runs can be overlaid in TonyPlot. The
simulation with lattice heating shows less current for a given voltage
than the isothermal case. The elevated temperature causes mobility
reduction in the semiconductor and hence lower currents.
