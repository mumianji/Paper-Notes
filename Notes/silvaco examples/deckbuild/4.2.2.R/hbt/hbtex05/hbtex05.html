This example demonstrates fabrication and analysis of SiGe HBT. A
bipolar device with a SiGe base created in Athena, and then passed to
Atlas for electrical analysis to extract a gummel plot and bipolar
gain. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 SiGe simulation in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of donor and acceptor dopants for SiGe material
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Athena-Atlas automatic interface 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 DC simulation for Ic and Ib versus Vbe 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example contains two parts. The first is the Athena process simulation
of the HBT, and the second is the Atlas electrical analysis. The whole of the
Atlas part of this example is as described in the first example in this
section with the exception of the Atlas structure specification syntax.
</p>
<p>
The Athena run starts by defining the mesh and the silicon substrate.
After the buried collector formation, the structure is flipped upside
down using
<br/>
<b> struct outf=&lt;file&gt;</b> <br/>
<b> init inf=&lt;file&gt; flip.y</b> <br/>
The next step is the deposition of the silicon germanium layer. SiGe
is a recognized material in FLASH so no special syntax is needed. The
remainder of the bipolar processing is use of typical process simulation
commands for base and emitter implant, silicon emitter layer and
various drive steps. Metal contacts are deposited, patterned and
defined using the
<b> electrode</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The key statement required for the Athena/Atlas interface is to define
the type of dopants that boron and phosphorus are in SiGe. This is
necessary for all materials in FLASH. The command
<b> impurity i.boron acceptor sige</b> sets boron as an acceptor-type dopant in SiGe. A similar statement sets
phosphorus as a donor-type dopant.
</p>
<p>
The line
<b> go atlas</b> defines the automatic interface with Atlas. In Atlas, no structure
specification syntax (including the mesh statement) is needed.
</p>
<p>
Results of the electrical simulation can be seen in TonyPlot. Ic and Ib
plots vs. Vbe can be seen from the log file. The band diagram and
other physical variables can be seen from the solution file.
