This example demonstrates avalanche breakdown in an AlGaAs/GaAs HBT with an
<b> abrupt heterojunction.</b> It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Device formation using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of an abrupt AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of models for AlGaAs and GaAs
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Ramping of the collector with an applied resistor until the breakdown voltage 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The structure specification part of this example is similar to the
previous example. The major difference is that this HBT as an abrupt
AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction as opposed to the graded composition
fraction used before. Specifying an abrupt junction is simple. No
grad.* parameters are used and the value of
<b> x.comp</b> on the
<b> region</b> statement is taken as the composition fraction throughout the AlGaAs
region right up to the GaAs region.
</p>
<p>
The models and material parameters are set exactly as in the previous
example. The only addition is the impact ionization model specified by
<b> impact selb.</b> Impact ionization parameters for ternary compounds such as AlGaAs are
not well defined and their dependence on composition fraction is known
even less. Tuning of the parameters of the impact statement might be
needed to match experimental results.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> contact</b> statement is used to specify a high value resistor at the collector electrode. This
provides for a smooth transition from voltage boundary conditions to current boundary
conditions during the ramping of external collector voltage. Note that such kind
of simulation could be performed using the curve tracing algorithm, providing automatic
selection of the loaded resistor.
</p>
<p>
The emitter voltage is ramped to -1.1V. Then, holding the
emitter voltage constant, the external collector voltage is ramped to 1.e9 V.
Due to the high value resistor, the value seen on the
semiconductor-to-collector contact will, of course, not increase to
such high levels.
</p>
<p>
The results of simulation are then displayed using TonyPlot. The x-axis
of the Ic/Vcb curve should be set to
<b> collector int. bias. </b> This is the collector voltage on the semiconductor contact as opposed
to the applied voltage across the resistor.
