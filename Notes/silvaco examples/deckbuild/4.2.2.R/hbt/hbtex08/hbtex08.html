In this example a DHBT structure based on the InP / InGaAs  material
system is constructed using Atlas.  The DHBT is then electrically tested,
and  properties  that  characterise  the  device&apos;s DC and high  frequency
performance  are calculated and presented.  The DC performance  is shown
through a gummel plot, and the DC current gain is calculated using the
functions property in TonyPlot. The AC performance is evaluated via
the cutoff frequency  ft, as well as the  maximum  oscillation  frequency
fmax. The cutoff  frequency  is  defined  as the
frequency  at  which  the  magnitude  of AC  current  gain ( i.e.  h21),
decreases  to unity.  It is  important  to note that the  transistor  is
connected in  common-emitter  configuration  for this  calculation.  The
maximum  oscillation  frequency  fmax  is the  frequency  at  which  the
unilateral power gain of the transistor  tends to unity.  The unilateral
power gain  effectively  represents the maximum power gain achievable by
the transistor. These properties can be improved though appropriate use
of  heterostructures,  stoichiometry  and  doping  to  lower  collective
resistance,  epitaxial  strain as well as several other properties, all
of which are incorporated within HBTs and indeed DHBTs offering superior performance to BJTs.
</p>
<p>
The superior performance encountered with HBTs and DHBTs is mainly due to
the presence of a quantum well in the emitter / base junction arising through
the use of two    materials   of    different    band   gap.   In   this
example InP / In(0.53)Ga(0.47)As  have been used.  The  quantum  well
stops  back  injection  of holes  from the base into the  emitter  which
will reduce the base  current and  consequently  increase the
current  gain.  The quantum  well will also permit the base doping to be
increased  which will lower the resistance  encountered  within the base
and reduce the transit time for electrons thus increasing
frequency  performance.  By adding a second  heterostructure  within the
collector   /   base   region   (i.e.  In(0.53)Ga(0.47)As / InP)   epitaxial
relationships are improved throughout the structural growth with an
overall improvement in device performance.
</p>
<p>
Another technique to improve a device&apos;s performance is to use a graded doping
profile.  This will aid in  controlling  electric  fields  concomitant  with
depletion regions and will improve breakdown characteristics. This example
demonstrates  this ability by  importing  doping  profiles  previously  specified  in an ASCII text
editor.  These files are called upon during the  construction  stage and
the doping profiles will be replicated accordingly.  In this example the
files used are
<b>  hbtex08_n.dat </b> and
<b>  hbtex08_p.dat </b> for n and p type doping respectively.  The user can simply  create an ASCII text file  having two
columns.  The left column  specifies  the depth  location  and the right
column specifies the concentration at that location.
</p>
<p>
An example would be:
</p>
<b> 0.0 1e16</b> <br/>
<b> 1.0 1e20</b> <br/>
<b> 1.001 0.0</b> <br/>
<b> 2.0 0.0</b> <br/>
<b>   ( Must put a carriage return here )</b> <br/>
<p>
As this is an ASCII file, a carriage  return  must be placed at the end of the
file. To use this file would require the commands:
</p>
<p>
doping (specify type) ascii infile=(filename)
</p>
<p>
It is also noted that interpolation is used between specified locations.
Consequently the doping profile must be set to zero through certain
locations if so desired. Otherwise an interpolated value will be used
until the end of the device is encountered. This is demonstated in the
above example.
</p>
<p>
The accuracy of the simulations is also improved by the use of Atlas-Interpreter
mobility models for the materials.  The models are based on &quot;Empirical low-field mobility
model for III-V compounds applicable in device simulation codes&quot;, M. Sotoodeh, A. H. Khalid,
and A. A. Rezazadeh, J. Appl. Phys., 87, 2890 (2000).
