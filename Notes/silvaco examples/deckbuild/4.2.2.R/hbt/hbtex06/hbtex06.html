In this example, an HBT structure based on the InGaAs-InP material system is
constructed using DEVEDIT. The structure is then passed to Atlas for
electrical testing. The input file consists of the following 2 main
portions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the device in DEVEDIT
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of the Gummel plot  in Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of the AC parameters 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 S-parameter extraction
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first stage of the input constructs the HBT geometry, material regions,
doping profiles, and electrodes in DEVEDIT. The n-p-n HBT device is based on
a lattice matched InGaAs-InP material system. It consists of
a highly doped InGaAs cap region followed by another cap region made of InP.
The next region, also made of InP, constitutes the actual emitter. As usual in
HBTs the emitter (InP) has wider energy band gap than the base and collector
(InGaAs). The base is followed by the n- subcollector and n+ collector regions.
The substrate is made of undoped InP.
</p>
<p>
The structure was created in DEVEDIT by drawing the device regions in
interactive mode and specifying 2D doping distribution. In this example
each region was uniformly doped. The Ga composition fraction of 0.47 was
also specified in DEVEDIT for each of the InGaAs regions. Finally the mesh was
generated automatically by specifying basic mesh constraints and refining it
along x- and/or y-directions in the important areas of the device.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas simulation begins by reading in the structure from DEVEDIT.
DeckBuild provides an automatic interface between DEVEDIT and Atlas so that the
structure produced by DEVEDIT is transferred to Atlas without having to
indicate the mesh statement.
</p>
<p>
The first active statements in the Atlas portion of the input file are
material parameters and models definition. In this example the energy band gap,
densities of states, and other fundamental material parameters for
InGaAs are calculated based on the composition specified in DEVEDIT.
For InP the respective default values are used.
The band alignment is defined using the
<b> align </b> parameter on the
<b> material</b> statement.  Material and model parameters can be specified in Atlas on
material-by-material or region-by-region basis. The latter possibility
is used here to define carrier lifetimes, low field mobilities, and
saturation velocities taking into consideration the doping levels in the
respective regions.
</p>
<p>
The same set of physical models is applied here to all the regions/materials:
Shockley-Read- Hall recombination, electric field dependent mobilities
with GaAs-like velocity-field characteristic, and Fermi-Dirac statistics.
To reflect the different properties of materials with regard to the critical
field,
<b> ecritn </b> is specified in
separate
<b> model </b> statements for InP and InGaAs.
</p>
<p>
The simulation is first performed to obtain the Gummel plot by biasing
simultaneously the base and collector with respect to the emitter up to 1.2 V.
At the same time, a small signal AC perturbation is applied at a frequency
of 1 MHz to calculate the AC parameters (conductances and capacitances) as
functions of Vbe. This also allows the user to obtain
the cutoff frequency using the low frequency approximation in TonyPlot
or using the extraction feature of DeckBuild. Currents, voltages, and AC
parameters are saved in a log file, and internal structure information
is saved for a bias condition (Vbe=Vce=0.95 V) where the cutoff frequency is
close to its maximum.  The calculation of s-parameters is specified on the
log statement with the s.param command.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the simulation,
<b> extract</b> statements are used to determine the maximum
cutoff frequency, the base bias, the input (base) capacitance, and the
transconductance - all at the bias of Vbe=Vce=1.0 V where the maximum cutoff
frequency was observed.
</p>
<p>
The structure plot, the Gummel plot, the AC current gain versus frequency, and S-parameters are then displayed using TonyPlot.
