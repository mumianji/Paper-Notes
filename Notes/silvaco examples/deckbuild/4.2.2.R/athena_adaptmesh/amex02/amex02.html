This example shows the fabrication of a PNP Bipolar device
structure using
<b> Elite </b> and
<b> SSuprem 4 </b> to model etching and
oxidation processes.
In this example, the
<b> ADAPTIVE MESHING </b> is turned on using the command
<b> method adapt</b> . The grid should be adapted during ion implantation and anneal process.
The initial grid setting is still using that designed by hand. However,
the first time use of the grid adaptation feature
<b> grid.model </b> allow the grid parameters to be optimized according to its application area,
e.g. PNP Bipolar device.
and stored in the template
<b> PNP</b> .
At this moment, the template
<b> PNP</b> only contains one line:
</p>
<b> adapt.par disable oxide</b> <b> adapt.par disable poly</b> <p>
This means do not use an adaptive grid in oxide and poly since the grid inside
oxide and poly is not important for PNP Bipolar devices.
