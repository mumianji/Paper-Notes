In this example, a CCD structure is constructed using Athena. This structure can be passed to ATLAS for electrical testing.
</p>
<p>
The first stage of the input constructs the CCD geometry and doping
profiles in Athena. The CCD device consists of a storage node on the
left of the structure controlled by a polysilicon gate. A transfer node
to the right of this structure is also controlled by both a polysilicon gate and a drain
region of heavy n+ doping with a metal contact.
</p>
<p>
The CCD structure has a n- active region at the surface above a p-type
substrate. Under the transfer node an extra p-type implant is given.
This implant is performed at sufficient dose level to create a potential
difference between the storage and transfer nodes, but is not so large
as to create a junction.
</p>
<p>
The process simulation is designed to run extremely quickly so there is
a minimum of diffusion steps included. The final stages of the Athena
input performs the electrode definition needed by ATLAS.  Also some
EXTRACT statements are used to measure the junction depth of the active
region under the storage and transfer nodes.
