This example demonstrates how to extract the optical output coupling efficiency
of an LED/OLED device by using various techniques including reverse ray-tracing,
the source term method and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD).
</p>
<p>
Reverse ray-tracing is a technique that allows us to obtain optical output
characteristics of an active optoelectronic device based on material
properties and device geometry. Ray-tracing is most commonly used for the modeling
of passive optoelectronic components such as photo-detectors. Rays originating
at the external light source are traced into the device and are absorbed to
form electron/hole pairs, which are subsequently detected.  Use of ray-tracing
method in LUMINOUS is shown in examples optoex08 - optoex15.
</p>
<p>
Contrary to
direct ray-tracing, the rays in the reverse method originate inside the active
region and are traced until they exit the device. One or multiple origin points
(user-specified) for rays are considered. Interference effects for rays originating
at the common source point can be taken into account. When interference is enabled,
the spectral selectivity of the device structure can be analyzed by performing
ray-tracing at multiple wavelengths.
</p>
<p>
The source term method works in a similar fashion but directly accounts
for interference effects by applying an algorithm akin to the
transfer matrix method which only applies to truely 1D devices.
</p>
<p>
The finite-difference time-domain method works by direct solution of
Maxwell&apos;s equations in the time domain and thus explicitly accounts for
interference and diffraction in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.
</p>
<p>
Both the source term method and FDTD use the same method as for ray
tracing in that the emission from a set of dipoles located at user
specified locations is integrated/averaged over the device.
</p>
<p>
The device structure and settings in this example are identical to those of
optoex06, where LED luminous efficiency calculation is demonstrated. See
the description of example optoex06 for more detailed
information.
</p>
<p>
An additional functionality of LUMINOUS to assess light extraction
from the device is implemented in the
<b> SAVE  </b> statements (after biasing). Five different sets of parameters for reverse
ray-tracing are used in successive
<b> SAVE </b> statements to demonstrate the features
available for the modeling of LEDs. The parameter sets are given in the order of
increasing complexity of simulation. Computation times also vary. It takes
approximately 200 times longer to run the last
<b> SAVE </b> line compared to the first
one.
</p>
<p>
The parameter
<b> angpower</b> should be set in the
<b> SAVE </b> statement in order to start the reverse ray-tracing algorithm. The name of the
output file containing the angular power density vs. output angle dependence
is specified as a value of the
<b> angpower </b> parameter. The information in the angpower file includes the angular power density
for TE- and TM- polarized light, as well as total angular power density and total
flux angular density vs. output angle.
Note: In TonyPlot polar charts, the y-axis is directed upward (in the opposite
direction to the internal coordinate system used in Atlas). Therefore, the plots
appear to be flipped around the x-axis (top of the structure is at the bottom of the
chart).
</p>
<p>
The parameter
<b> rayplot </b> specifies the name of the output file containing the information on each ray
exiting the device. This file is only created when a single origin for all rays
is assumed. The information includes ray output angle, relative ray power
(TE-, TM-polarization, and total), and initial internal angle at the origin
(only if the
<b> interfere </b> parameter is not specified). 0-degree angle corresponds to
the rays in the X axis direction, 90-degree angle corresponds to the rays in
the Y axis direction.
</p>
<p>
To start ray-tracing from one point of origin the user has to specify the
following parameters:
coordinates of the origin of rays
<b> X </b> and
<b> Y </b> and wavelength
<b> L.WAVE</b> . It is important that the origin be chosen in the active region of the device.
Rays are not traced if the radiative recombination is zero at the ray origin.
All remaining parameters, outlined below, are optional and their default values
are assumed if the parameters are not specified.
</p>
<b> Reflects </b> <p>
specifies a number of reflections to be traced for each ray originating at the point
<b> X </b> ,
<b> Y </b> (similar to
<b> reflects </b> parameter in the
<b> BEAM </b> statement). The default value (
<b> REFLECTS</b> =0) provides for a quick estimate of the coupling efficiency.
<b> REFLECTS</b> &gt;0 should be used to obtain a more accurate result, especially if
<b> MIR.TOP </b> or
<b> MIR.BOTTOM </b> are specified. The choice of this parameter is based on a compromise between
calculation time and accuracy. The maximum allowed value is
<b> REFLECTS</b> =10. the number of reflections set to 3 or 4 is often a good choice. The parameter
set #1 produces a simple ray-tracing analysis of an LED considered in this
example.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> MIR.TOP </b> parameter specifies that the top surface of the device be treated as an ideal mirror.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> MIR.BOTTOM </b> parameter specifies that the bottom surface of the device be treated as an ideal
mirror.
</p>
<b> SIDE </b> <p>
specifies that the rays reaching the sides of the device are terminated
there and do not contribute to the total light output. This is often a good
assumption for realistic LEDs as these rays tend to be either absorbed internally
or blocked by the casing of the device.
</p>
<b> TEMPER </b> <p>
is the temperature needed for using appropriate refractive indexes of the
materials. A default setting of 300 K will be used if not specified.
</p>
<b> POLAR </b> <p>
specifies polarization of the emitted photons in degrees (linearly polarized
light is assumed). Parallel (TM-mode,
<b> POLAR</b> =0.0) and perpendicular (TE-mode,
<b> POLAR</b> =90.0) polarizations result in significantly different output coupling values.
The default value (
<b> POLAR</b> =45.0) should be used if there is no preferred direction of polarization of
emitted photons (unpolarized light emission).
</p>
<b> MIN.POWER </b> <p>
specifies the minimum relative power of a ray (similar to
<b> min.power </b> parameter in the
<b> BEAM </b> statement). The ray is not traced after its power falls below
<b> min.power </b> value. This is useful for limiting the number of rays traced, and the default
value is 1e-4.
</p>
<b> NUMRAYS </b> <p>
is used to specify the number of rays starting from the origin. The default is 180,
the acceptable range 36 - 3600.
</p>
<p>
Parameter set #2 shows how some of the parameters described above are used for
modeling a realistic LED. The angular distribution of light power obtained
in optoex18ang_2.log exhibits a Lambertian pattern, which is what we expect for
a simple LED considered in this example. Note that the optical coupling coefficient
produced in this calculation reflects the 2D nature of the example (the light
origin is not a point but rather an infinite line in z-direction). Simultaneously,
it is possible to calculate the optical coupling efficiency for an axially
symmetric 3D device (normally this is the value to be compared with experimental
results). This calculation is enabled if
<b> coupling3D </b> parameter is specified (while
<b> side </b> is also set). For this calculation the light source is assumed to be
a point located on the axis of symmetry.
</p>
<p>
The rays are assummed to be incoherent by default. This is a good approximation
if the thickness of the active layer of the device is on the order of a
wavelength/index. For layer thicknesses &lt;&lt; wavelength coherent effects might be
important. When the
<b> interfere </b> parameter is set, the rays originating at the common source point are taken to
be 100% coherent. In this case the phase information upon propagation is
preserved. Phase change upon reflection is also considered. Thus, interference
of rays exiting the device at the same angle is taken into account. The internal
angle information is not written to the output rayfile in this case. The parameter
set #3 takes interference into account.
</p>
<p>
Absorption of rays can be taken into account when the
<b> absorb</b> parameter is set. The absorption is assumed to be constant specified for each
material by the imaginary part of the refractive index.
Carrier density dependent absorption and photon-recycling are not considered
at this point.
</p>
<p>
Although ray-tracing from one point of origin can give a reasonable estimate
of optical output coupling and angular distribution of light power, it is often
desirable to consider multiple points within the active layer of the device to
obtain more accurate results. Multiple origin points can be set using the
following parameters:
</p>
<b> XMIN</b> <p>
,
<b> XMAX</b> ,
<b> YMIN</b> ,
<b> YMAX </b> define a rectangular area containing all origin points.
<b> XNUM </b> and
<b> YNUM </b> specify the number of points along x- and y- axes within the rectangular area.
If
<b> XNUM </b> is equal to 1, the x-coordinate of all origin points is set to
<b> XMIN </b> so that the points are chosen along the line x =
<b> XMIN</b> . Similarly, points along the specific y-line can be chosen.
Ray-tracing from multiple origins is realized by repeating a single
origin algorithm for each point and by adding up the normalized angular power
density values thus obtained. The luminous power assigned to each source (origin)
is proportional to the radiative recombination at that point. Luminous power of
all sources adds up to the value obtained by integration of radiative recombination
over the entire device. Rays originating at different source points are completely
incoherent (even when
<b> interfere </b> is set), which is consistent with the spontanuous character of the radiation produced
by an LED. The rayplot file is not written for multiple origins (even if parameter
<b> rayplot </b> is specified). The parameter set #4 shows how multiple origin simulation can be done.
</p>
<p>
Spectral selectivity of optical output coupling for LEDs can also be taken into
account. Reverse ray-tracing at multiple wavelengths is
considered if the
<b> spectrum </b> parameter specifies a filename for spectral selectivity output, while the
<b> angpower </b> parameter is also set.
<b> EMIN </b> and
<b> EMAX </b> , or
<b> LMIN </b> and
<b> LMAX</b> specify the energy or wavelength range respectively.
<b> NSAMP </b> specifies the number of spectral components to be considered. It is suggested
that the
<b> SPECTRUM </b> file is specified only when
<b> interfere </b> is set (a warning is issued otherwise, while ray-tracing proceeds).  When
<b> ANGPOWER </b> and
<b> SPECTRUM </b> parameters are set in the
<b> SAVE</b> statement, the resulting optical output coupling is averaged over the
entire energy (wavelength) range from
<b> EMIN </b> to
<b> EMAX </b> (from
<b> LMIN </b> to
<b> LMAX</b> ). The same applies to the quantities in the output angular distribution
file. The spectrum file only shows how output coupling changes with wavelength.
At the moment the shape of the gain curve is not taken into account (flat gain).
The set of parameters #5 shows how multiple spectral components can be considered.
The results obtained after averaging over spectral components and multiple origin
points while taking interference into account are remarkably similar to the single
point source model, where interference and multiple spectral content has been
ignored (parameter set #2). This demonstrates the applicability of a simpler model
in this case.
