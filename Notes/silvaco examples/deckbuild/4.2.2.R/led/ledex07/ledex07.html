This example demonstrates how to extract the optical output coupling efficiency
of an LED/OLED device by using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD).
</p>
<p>
The finite-difference time-domain method works by direct solution of
Maxwell&apos;s equations in the time domain and thus explicitly accounts for
interference and diffraction in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.
</p>
<p>
FDTD uses the same method as reverse ray
tracing in that the emission from a set of dipoles located at user
specified locations is integrated/averaged over the device.
</p>
<p>
The device in this case is very similar to the ones discussed in
the other examples so far.  We have broadened it out in the
X direction so we can analyze the effects of guided modes.  Guided
modes are light trapped in the plane of the device by total internal
reflection.  We make the device very long the make sure we can
capture all the light except that which is definitely captured
in the axial modes.
</p>
<p>
In the next example we will analyze the effect of introduction
of a photonic coupling structure on the top surface to extract light
from the axial modes.  This demonstrates the advantage of FDTD analysis
for photonic coupling.  This kind of analysis cannot be done with
reverse ray trace or source term methods.
</p>
<p>
The main difference from what we have seen so far in the other examples
in the introduction of the
<b> BEAM </b> statement.  In example ledex05.in
we performed FDTD analysis without the use of the BEAM statement.
In this case the
<b> BEAM </b> statement is made automatically based on
certain assumptions.
</p>
<p>
Many of the functionalities available on the
<b> BEAM </b> statement (including
lenses) for FDTD
analysis are not yet available on the
<b> SAVE </b> or
<b> LED </b> statements so
the
<b> BEAM </b> statement is used here as a convenience and to illustrate
the full variety of control parameters available to FDTD analysis.
</p>
<p>
In the
<b> BEAM </b> statement you will first notice the specification of beam origin,
direction of propogation and wavelength.  These specifications are largely
supurfulous for LED analysis but need be specified in accordance
with the syntactical rules set forth for photo detection in
Luminous.  In future LED versions we hope to hide much of this.
</p>
<p>
The important parameters for LED analysis are
<b> FDTD </b> which enables FDTD analysis,
<b> TD.SRATE </b> which specifies the number of samples per wavelength
<b> PROP.LENG </b> which specifies the duration of the simulation in terms
of optical propogation length,
<b> BIG.INDEX </b> which enables examination of the largest index of refraction
in each region to calculate the local mesh spacing relative
to the local wavelength and
<b> FD.AUTO </b> which enables automatic meshing.
</p>
<p>
PMLs are absorbing boundary conditions for FDTD. They are needed at the
TOP to characterize the amount of light exiting the top of the device
(i.e. the light coupled out of the device).  PMLs are placed at the
ends of the device to capture and characterize the axial modes.
</p>
<p>
The PML at the bottom is optional and if left out the boundary is
treated as a prefect mirror.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of the simulation the
<b> SAVE </b> statement is used to initiate FDTD coupling analysis at the
operating bias.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> REF.BEAM </b> parameter is used to specify the index of the
<b> BEAM </b> in order to tie the LED analysis to the proper set of analysis conditions
set up by the
<b> BEAM </b> and
<b> PML </b> statements.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> SPECTRUM </b> parameter specifies a file prefix for capturing the
coupled output spectrum.
</p>
<p>
The other parameters of the
<b> SAVE </b> statement specify the user selected sampling in space and emission
wavelength.
