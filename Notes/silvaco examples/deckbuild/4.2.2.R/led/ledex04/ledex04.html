This example demonstrate how the radiative recombination models of LED
in 2 dimensional Atlas can be used to analyze the electro-luminescence in
rectangular vs. cylindrical domains.
</p>
<p>
The objective of this example is to obtain and compare the basical LED
characteristics such as the I-V-L curve depenenced on the simulation domain.
The cylindrical domain characteristics are obtained in the same manner
as in the rectangular except the
<b> CYLINDRICAL </b> parameter should be set on the
<b> MESH </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
Also for cylindrical analysis only the right half of the X-Y plane
should be defined.
</p>
<p>
There are 7 sections to define the structure, material models,
biasing conditions and data extraction of the operational characteristics.
</p>
<p>
In this example there are two input decks.  The first deck specifies
the 2D experiment.
</p>
<b> Mesh Generation</b> <p>
In the first section of the input file, the unit of the rectangular
domain is chosen as [A] with
<b> WIDTH </b> parameter of
<b> MESH </b> statement. Device
size is 3.14*4^2 um2 as 8um diameter, so 12.566 [um]  to make the exact
Anode Area on top view, set on
<b> WIDTH </b> parameter.
</p>
<b> Region and Electrode Specification</b> <p>
This section defines a 5 layer GaAs/AlGaAs diode with compositional grading
in layers numbered 2 and 5.  In region 2 the composition fraction of Al
increases from 0.0 at the top to 0.35 at the bottom of the layer.  This
grading is specified using the
<b> X.COMP </b> and
<b> GRAD.12 </b> parameters of the
<b> REGION </b> statement.  Similar definitions are used in the
<b> REGION statement for region number 5</b> .
</p>
<p>
The ANODE and CATHODE contacts are defined on the top and bottom of the device.
</p>
<b> Doping Profiles</b> <p>
Layers 1 and 2 have a P-type doping of 1e18 cm-3. Layer 3 is P-type doped
at 1e15 cm-3. Layers 4 and 5 are doped at 2e18 cm-3 N-type.
All doping profiles have a uniform distribution within the region.
</p>
<b> Material and Models</b> <p>
The
<b> MATERIAL</b> statements in this section define parameters for the radiative recombination
rate constant,
<b> COPT</b> , the low field mobilities,
<b> MUN</b> , the satruation velocity,
<b> VSAT</b> and the conduction band alignment,
<b> ALIGN</b> .
</p>
<p>
The
<b> MODELS </b> statement in this section selects models for Fermi-Dirac statistics,
<b> FERM</b> , Auger recombination,
<b> AUGER</b> , radiative recombination,
<b> OPTR</b> , and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination,
<b> SRH</b> .
</p>
<b> Outputs</b> <p>
Many parameters are output to any generated structure files by default.
The
<b> OUTPUT </b> statement can be specified to include quantities that are not output
by default.  In this case the conduction band edge energy,
<b> CON.BAND</b> , the valence band edge energy,
<b> VAL.BAND</b> , various band parameters (e.g. Eg, Nc, Nv etc.),
<b> BAND.PARAM</b> , various recombination rates,
<b> RECOMB, U.SRH, U.AUG, U.RAD</b> , and the current flowlines,
<b> FLOWLINES</b> .
</p>
<b> Initial Solution and Bias Ramp</b> <p>
In these sections the bias conditions of the diode are set on various
<b> SOLVE </b> statements.  Structure files showing the internal conditions of the device
are saved at various biases using
<b> SAVE </b> statements.  The
<b> LOG </b> statment is used to capture terminal conditions as well as the
integrated radiative and total recombination rates using the
<b> PROBE </b> statements.
</p>
<p>
The second deck performs the cylindrical device analysis.  It is instructive
to compare the two decks.  The second deck is identical to the first one
except that the device is defined as a cylindrical device using the
<b> CYLINDRICAL </b> parameter of the
<b> MESH </b> statement.
</p>
<b> Plotting Curves</b> <p>
The I-V curve compared and I-L curve calculated using the
<b> EXTRACT </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The current flowlines dependency on the device domain and bais point is also
shown.
