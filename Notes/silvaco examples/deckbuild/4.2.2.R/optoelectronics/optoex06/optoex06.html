This example demonstrates how the radiative recombination models
in Atlas can be used to analyze the luminous efficiency
and of LED devices.
</p>
<p>
The objective of this example is to forward bias the LED such that
radiative recombination occurs in the active layer of the device.  Then
by extracting the integrated radiative recombination rate and total
integrated recombination rate, the luminous efficiency
of the device can be measured.  Also, the integrated radiative recombination rate as a
function of bias voltage can be extracted to estimate the luminous
power versus bias voltage.
</p>
<b> Mesh Generation </b> <p>
In the first section of the input file, a mesh
covering an area of 4 microns by 4 microns is defined.  The mesh uses the
&quot;diag.flip&quot; option since it is symmetric about the center in &quot;X&quot;.
Mesh spacings are specified to try to resolve the heterojunctions
in the &quot;Y&quot; direction and the doping profiles in the &quot;X&quot; direction.
An eliminate statement is used to reduce the number of grid points
used, in the direction of the substrate.  Also, the value of the
&quot;space.mult&quot; parameter has been set to 2.0 to provide faster
simulation.  For better accuracy (and longer simulation time)
this value should be set to a smaller number.
</p>
<b> Region and Electrode Specification </b> <p>
The device is composed of five regions: a GaAs &quot;p&quot; contact
region, an AlGaAs cladding layer, the GaAs active
region, a second AlGaAs cladding layer and an
n-type GaAs substrate.  In this example the &quot;grad&quot; parameters
were used to grade the heterojunctions between the first and
second layers and the fourth and fifth layers.  The heterojunctions
at both sides of the active layer are modeled as abrupt.
</p>
<p>
A &quot;p&quot; contact electrode is defined at the center of the top of the
device.  The &quot;p&quot; contact is narrower than the device to confine the
photo-luminescence to a narrow region in the active layer.  The
substrate electrode extends across the device at the bottom.
</p>
<b> Doping Profile Specification</b> <p>
The doping profiles in the device are specified in the third section
of the input file.  Here the first three layers are lightly doped
&quot;P&quot; type, while the last two layers are heavily doped &quot;N&quot; type.
In addition a &quot;P+&quot; type profile is defined around the &quot;p&quot; contact.
</p>
<b> Material Models</b> <p>
In the fourth section of the file,  a set of material
and model parameters is specified.  For analyzing luminous efficiency,
all principal recombination mechanisms are selected.  In addition,
a radiative recombination constant for all the
materials is set.  In the solution part of the file
the individual contributions of the various mechanisms to estimate
luminous efficiency will be extracted.
</p>
<b> Output</b> <p>
In the fifth section of the file, the various
output parameters that will be written to the solution file during
the solution process are chosen.  These parameters will allow the user to look
at the conduction band edge energy, the valence band edge energy,
the total recombination rate, the SRH recombination rate, the
Auger recombination rate and the radiative recombination rate.
</p>
<b> Initial Solution</b> <p>
In the sixth section of the file, an initial
solution with no carriers is done.  This usually provides a good
initial guess for the full, 2 carrier solutions to follow.
</p>
<b> Bias Ramp</b> <p>
In the seventh section of the file the bias voltage
across the LED is ramped from 0.0 V to 2.0 V in the forward bias direction.
In this section a full two carriers solution  will be done so
that recombination data can be observed.  In the first line
of this section of the file, an output log file
is specified. Current-voltage data will be written to this file. In the
solve statement, a luminous wavelength
<b> l.wave </b> is set so that luminous power can be extracted during the ramp.  In
addition, the saving of an output file is set in the solve statement so
that  snapshots of the device can be displayed at each step of the
bias ramp.
</p>
<b> Extraction</b> <p>
In the last section of the input file, the integrated
total and radiative components of the recombination rate in the
device are extracted.  The luminous efficiency can be estimated by the ratio
of these values.
</p>
<b> Results</b> <p>
From these  results,  the luminous efficiency can be calculated.
The luminous efficiency is defined at the ratio of the radiative
recombination rate to the total recombination rate.  The extracted
values of these rates should be printed at the end of the run, giving
a ratio a value of 70%.
</p>
<p>
To view the results, first start up TonyPlot with the solution file .
This file corresponds to the device structure after the completed
voltage ramp. Once TonyPlot has started you should choose to display
a contour plot of the radiative recombination rate.  In this plot
we can see the relative luminescence in the active layer compared
to other regions of the device.  In this case most of the radiative
recombination should be confined to the active layer of the device.
</p>
<p>
The log file contains all the terminal characteristics.  This file
contains values of the calculated luminescent power as a function of
device bias voltage.  Once the file is loaded into TonyPlot you should
select to display &quot;anode bias&quot; along the x axis and &quot;Luminescent power&quot;
along the y axis.  In this figure it is seen that the device &quot;turns-on&quot; at
about 1.4 Volts.
