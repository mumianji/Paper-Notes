This example demonstrates:
<br/>
 </p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Crosstalk as well as Quantum efficiency as a function of
InSb detector design parameters.
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Crosstalk is one of the main parameters that critically affect the
resolution of detector arrays. Electrical crosstalk is attributed
to carriers that are photogenerated under one detector, diffusing
and being collected by another detector in the array. As the photodiode
size and the pitch (distance between photodiodes) of the detector
array get smaller, there is a greater probability of crosstalk influencing
system performance since the probability of a generated carrier being
collected by a neighboring junction increases. Atlas will be used to
study the crosstalk and also the quantum efficiency of a 5 x 5 InSb
detector arrays in the three dimensional domain.

<p>
The structure consists of InSb photodiodes fabricated on top of the
InSb buffer layer. The p+ regions were doped with acceptor concentration
of 1 x 1019 cm-3 and the buffer layer was doped with donor concentration
of 1 x 1015 cm-3. The contacts on these photodiodes are ohmic and they
are named as anode 1, anode 2, ... anode 25 in the simulation. The cathode
is formed on top of the buffer layer surrounding the photodiodes.
</p>
<p>
In this simulation, a multi-spectral source will be used and the source
will be a black-body radiator operating at a temperature of 2000 Kelvin.
The
<b> power.file </b> parameter in the
<b> BEAM </b> statement will be used for that purpose.
</p>
<p>
A parametrized input deck
<b> optoex17.in </b> was created with 4 parameters which are the
<b> size of the pixel </b> the
<b> pitch between pixel </b> the
<b> InSb epilayer thickness </b> and
<b> InSb buffer layer thikness </b> </p>
<p>
The variation of these parameters are made using the
<b> DBInternal </b> capability of DeckBuild. The file name is
<b> optoex17_doe.in </b> . See
<b> DOE: Design of Experimenst Example </b> section of DeckBuild for more information on how to use
<b> DBInternal</b> .
</p>
<p>
To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load  </b> button in DeckBuild. This will copy the input file and any support
files to your current working directory.
<b> optoex17.in </b> will be loaded by default. You should load
<b> optoex17_doe.in </b> for design parameters variation using DBInternal. Once loaded into
DeckBuild, select the
<b> run </b> button to execute the example.
