This example demonstrates:
<br/>
 </p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Diffraction of a spatially confined beam
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example shows an added capability of Luminous to describe
diffraction in 2D. The input deck of this example is identical to that
of optoex10.in except for the
<b> bpm</b> parameter in the
<b> BEAM </b> statement. This
parameter specifies that the beam propagation method be used by
Luminous instead of ray tracing. This is equivalent to using the wave
optics approach instead of geometrical optics. The effects of optical
wave diffraction and interference are automatically taken into
account when the beam propagation method is used.
</p>
<p>
Diffraction effects of a Gaussian beam propagating in silicon is shown
in this particular example.
</p>
<p>
Other parameters that can be specified in the beam statement for the
beam propagation method are
<b> longit.step </b> and
<b> transv.step</b> . These parameters are used to set respective step sizes for the internal bpm
grid. When the step sizes are not defined explicitly, the default
values are used. The default step size in both directions is equal to
wavelength/16.0. It is
<b> emphatically not recommended </b> to use step sizes
larger than wavelength/2.0, especially if coherent effects are of
interest. The user is also cautioned against use of extremely small step
sizes as they can result in unnecessarily long computation times.
Default values provide for adequate treatment in most cases.
</p>
<p>
Some parameters specific for the ray tracing are ignored in the beam
propagation method. For details, see BEAM statement in the Atlas
manual.
