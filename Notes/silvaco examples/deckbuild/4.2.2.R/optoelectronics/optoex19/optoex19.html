This example demonstrates:
<br/>
 The Atlas Geiger mode capability for a 3D avalanche photodiode operated as a
single photon counter at biases beyond breakdown - the Geiger counter mode.
<br/>
This 3D APD was made from silicon and  simulated in 2 cylindrical coordinates (r,y).
The anode is a diffused p+ disc in 6 microns of epitaxial n- silicon on n+ silicon substrate.
</p>
<p>
IV characteristics (dark as well under illumination) are simulated by ramping
the cathode voltage up to around 36V where the diode starts to break down
and then beyond to 45V where the Geiger mode comes into play.
</p>
<p>
For the Geiger mode simulation, a probe statement was added so that the electron
avalanche probabilities at the designated point versus bias could be seen on the log file.
The cathode was ramped to 70V, a bias at which single electrons or holes at some points
in the device have a 100% chance of initiating an avalanche.  The probabilities can be seen
in the 2D plots at several biases as wellas in the log file at the probed coordinates.
