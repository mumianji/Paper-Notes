This example deals with time domain response of the device
to time dependent optical sources.  This example
will extract the transient response of the device to an optical
source being &quot;turned off&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The first and second sections of the input file are the same as in the
DC example described previously. The first section specifies that the device
structure is read in from an external file. The second section specifies the material
models used.  The third section of the file specifies a normally
incident monochromatic source.  The wavelength of the source is 623 nm,
equivalent to a HeNe laser wavelength.
</p>
<p>
The fourth section of the input file sets the initial biasing
conditions of the device.  Here again the device is biased
to 2.0 volts.
</p>
<p>
The last section of the input file specifies the transient.  In this
case the DC solution at a source intensity of 5 W/cm^2 is obtained.
Then, the source intensity is ramped linearly to 0 over a time
of 1 ns.  Terminal data is then collected over the next 9 ns.  The
terminal data is saved to the log file.
</p>
<p>
The results of the example are viewed in TonyPlot. They compare the
available photo current with the cathode current as a function of
time.  In this case the cathode current lags the source transient by a
fraction of a nanosecond.
