The following set of examples demonstrates how to extract device
characteristics for general photodetectors.  These characteristics are
of interest to those involved in the design of PN and PIN photodiodes,
avalanche photodiodes, photoconductors, phototransistors, optical FETs
and MSMs.  These examples focus principally on optoelectronic
characteristics as opposed to the purely electronic behavior of
photodetectors (e.g. dark current, capacitance).
</p>
<p>
The following examples will address a PIN photodetector.  The extraction
techniques used on the PIN device will equally apply to other
photodetector devices.  The device for these examples is described
in the input file &quot;optoex01.in&quot;.  This input file should be run before
any of the other examples in this section as it provides the base
device structure used in the other examples.
</p>
<p>
The first section of the input file specifies the mesh.  In this
case, the mesh is 10 microns by 10 microns.  The spacings were chosen
to help resolve the P+ N and N N+ junctions.  The
<b> space.mult </b> parameter is used to make the mesh coarse for fast simulation.  For more accuracy,
the value should be set to unity.
</p>
<p>
The second section of the input file specifies the structure of the
device.  The device is a square of silicon with an anode extending
across the front surface (y=0.0) and a cathode across the bottom.
It is uniformly doped N-type at 1.0e14, with heavily doped P+ and
N+ regions at the front and back surfaces respectively.
</p>
<p>
The third section of the input file specifies which material models
will be used in the simulation.  Here SRH and Auger recombination
mechanisms have been specified since they have important effects
on the quantum efficiency of photodiodes.  Concentration and
field dependent mobility models are also specified.
</p>
<p>
The last section of the input file is used to obtain an initial
solution.  The initial solution is written to a solution file that is
used in all the subsequent photodetector analysis examples.  The output
file   can be viewed using TonyPlot.  This shows the structure of the
device and the device mesh.
