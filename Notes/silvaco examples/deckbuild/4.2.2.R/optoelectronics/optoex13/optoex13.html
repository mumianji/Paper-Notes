This example demonstrates:
<br/>
 </p>
<ul>
  <li>
 How to define an optical source that has a small signal ac optical component.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This input file analyzes the small signal response of a 3D device
to a small signal optical source.
</p>
<p>
The first four sections of the input file are similiar to the
corresponding sections in the input file for example optoex01.in
described previously.
</p>
<p>
The fifth section of the file defines the optical source in a similiar manner to example optoex10.in described previously.
The applied bias to the cathode contact is then increased to 2 V with no applied light.
</p>
<p>
The sixth section defines an optical source intensity of 1 mW/cm^2 and a small signal response of the device to this optical source is extracted
for each decade in frequency between 0.1 MHz and  100GHz  inclusive. The
full AC terminal characteristics  are saved in the log file.
</p>
<p>
When the results are viewed in TonyPlot it shows that the device has a
cutoff frequency of about 1 GHz.
