This example demonstrates:
<br/>
 </p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Standing wave pattern created by interfering waves
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example shows an added capability of Luminous to describe coherent
effects in 2D. The
<b> bpm </b> parameter used in the beam statement ensures
that the beam propagation method be used by Luminous instead of ray
tracing. This is equivalent to using the wave optics approach instead of
geometrical optics. The effects of optical wave diffraction and
interference are automaticly taken into account when the beam
propagation method is used.
</p>
<p>
Interference between forward propagating wave and back reflected wave
creates a standing wave pattern shown in this particular example.
</p>
<p>
Other parameters that can be specified in the beam statement for the
beam propagation method are
<b> longit.step </b> and
<b> transv.step</b> . These
parameters are used to set respective step sizes for the internal bpm
grid. When the step sizes are not defined explicitly, the default
values are used. The default step size in both directions is equal to
wavelength/16.0. It is
<b> emphatically not recommended </b> to use step sizes
larger than wavelength/2.0, especially if coherent effects are of
interest. The user is also cautioned against use of extremely small step
sizes as they can result in unnecessarily long computation times.
Default values provide for adequate treatment in most cases.
