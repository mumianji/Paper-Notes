This input file analyzes the small signal response of the device
to a small signal optical source.
</p>
<p>
The first four sections of the input file are identical to the
corresponding sections in the input file for the DC example
described previously.
</p>
<p>
The fifth section of the file specifies that a DC solution at
a source intensity of 5 W/cm^2 is obtained.  After the DC
solution, the small signal response of the device to an small
signal optical source of 1 mW/cm^2 is extracted for frequencies
ranging from 100KHz to 100GHz.  The full AC terminal characteristics
are saved in the log file.
</p>
<p>
When the results are viewed in TonyPlot, they show that the device has a
cutoff frequency of about 1 GHz.
