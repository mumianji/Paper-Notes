The first example involves characterization of steady state
characteristics of the device, and demonstrates extraction of
DC currents as a function of optical source power.  It
also demonstrates the use of multi-spectral sources.  The source
spectrum is described in the file &quot;optoex02.spec&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The first section of the input file specifies that the mesh
and device structure is taken from the previous example. The second section
of the file sets the same material models that were specified
in the previous example.
</p>
<p>
The third section of the input file specifies the optic source.
In this example the source originates 1 micron above the device
and is directed normal to the front surface of the device.  The
source spectrum is described in the file &quot;optoex02.spec&quot;.  This
spectrum is sampled at 5 discrete samples between the wavelengths
of 0.5 and 0.8 microns.
</p>
<p>
The fourth section of the file sets up the initial operating
bias for the simulation.  In this case an operating bias of 2.0 volts
is chosen.
</p>
<p>
The last section of the input file specifies that the optical
source intensity will be ramped from 0 to 1 W/cm^2.  During
this ramp, steady state currents are extracted and saved in
the log file.

The results are displayed by TonyPlot. The first figure shows several
curves.  The first, source photo current, is the equivalent current
what would be observed if all the light from the source were detected.
The second curve, available photo current is the equivalent current
that would be observed if all the light absorbed were converted to
terminal current.  The difference between the source and available
photo currents is due to part of the light passing all the way through
the device.  The third curve is the cathode current.  By taking the
ration of the cathode current with the source photo current, the quantum
efficiency as a function of source intensity is plotted in the second
figure.  Here the device quantum efficiency is about 91% and is
relatively independent of source intensity.
