The first four sections of the input file are similiar to the
corresponding sections in the input file for example optoex01.in
described previously.
</p>
<p>
The fifth section describes the beam properties and follows in general the beam
properties of example optoex10.in described previously.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas, by default, an unspecified boundary condition for device simulation
is assumed mirror or periodic.  However, for ray tracing by default the edges
of the device are considered interfaces with a vacuum, and therefore reflections
are calculated along these boundaries. In some cases it is useful to be able to
specify the edges to be periodic in regards to ray tracing as well. This is
particularly true when the beam is not normal to the plane.
</p>
<p>
This example runs two simulations; the first with the default boundary conditions
for ray tracing, and the second with periodic boundary conditions for the rays.
The periodic boundary conditions are chosen by the
<b> periodic</b> parameter of the BEAM statement.
