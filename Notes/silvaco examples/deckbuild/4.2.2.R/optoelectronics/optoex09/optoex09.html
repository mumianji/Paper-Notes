This example shows how anti-reflective coatings can be simulated in
Atlas. This example demonstrates:
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of simple silicon region
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of normally incident light beam
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Definition of anti-reflective layer using the INTERFACE statement
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of spectral response
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The structure and beam definition sections of this example are similar
to other simple examples in this section. The wavelength of the beam
will be set on the
<b> solve</b> lines, so it is not defined in the
<b> beam</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> interface </b> statement is used to define optical properties of a coating associated
with that interface. A user can define an anti-reflective coating
(considered in this example), a dielectric mirror, or an ideally reflecting
surface using the
<b> interface </b> statement. Note that the coating is not physically present in
the structure defined for Atlas. This allows a user to specify certain
optical properties while not affecting electrical properties of the structure.
The parameter
<b> ar.thick </b> defines the thickness of the coating layer.
<b> ar.index </b> defines the refractive index of the layer. Most commonly the thickness
of a single-layer anti-reflective coating is a quarter of a wavelength
(in the material of the coating). For a single-layer coating or for the
first layer of a multi-layer coatingi, a user needs to specify the coordinates
of the points defining the coated surface
<b> p1.x</b> ,
<b> p1.y</b> ,
<b> p2.x</b> , and
<b> p2.y</b> .
If a coating has more than one layer, each subsequent layer must have
the number of the coating and the number of the layer specified by parameters
<b> coating </b> and
<b> layer</b> .
Coatings should be specified in order. Layers of one coating should also
be specified in order from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>
If a coating is made of an absorbing material, it is possible to take absorption
into account by specifying
<b> ar.absorb </b> parameter. Totally reflective coatings are also allowed. The coating will
behave as an ideal reflector if
<b> ar.index </b> parameter is set to a value &gt; 1000.
</p>
<p>
The refractive indexes in the structure can be checked using the
<b> index.check </b> parameter. This produces output of the real and imaginary index in the silicon
as a function of the specified wavelength.
</p>
<p>
The final plot compares the spectral response of the cases with and
without the ARC. Note the increase around 0.6um wavelength for the one-layer
ARC. A two-layer coating is capable of reducing the reflectivity over a wide
range of wavelengths. In this example the terminal current is not important
since we consider a one terminal device with no applied bias.
The
<i> source photocurrent</i> is the amount of current generated by the light source.
<i> available photocurrent</i> is the amount of current absorbed by the semiconductor. Differences
between these two are due to reflection, transmission or absorption in
non-semiconductor materials. The ratio of available/source photocurrents
is often known as
<i> external quantum efficiency.</i> This quantity can be plotted using the functions in TonyPlot.
