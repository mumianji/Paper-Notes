This example illustrates a method for tuning the shape of bird&apos;s beak
by varying elastic characteristics. This example also demonstrates
how user defined materials can be created and used in Athena.
</p>
<p>
The example creates a comparison between the default coefficients for
nitride and a user defined material that is similar to nitride but with
modified elastic constants.
</p>
<p>
The simulation begins with the initial mesh definition in silicon.
</p>
<p>
Following the
<b> INITIALIZE </b> statement, a
<b> MATERIAL </b> statement redefines elastic constants for the new material
<b> nitride1</b> . The elastic constant
<b> s11.elast</b> is a reverse value of Young&apos;s modulus for non-crystalline materials. This means that the aritficial material
<b> nitride1 </b> is much stiffer than default nitride.
</p>
<p>
The new material can now be deposited and patterned just like any other
default material in
<b> Athena</b> .
A deposition and an etch of
<b> nitride1 </b> is performed.
</p>
<p>
Following the patterning of the new material, nitride is deposited and
patterned, so that the structure has the right side with a nitride
barrier to oxidation and the left side with a barrier made of the user
defined stiff material
<b> nitride1 </b> .
</p>
<p>
The structure is then oxidized and the final structure is plotted.  The
final structure shows that
<b> nitride1 </b> is flexed much less than default nitride which results in a different shaped bird&apos;s beak on each side.
