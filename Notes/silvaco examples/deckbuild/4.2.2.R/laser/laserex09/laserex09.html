This example demonstrates the simulation of a tunnel injection
InGaAsP/InAsP disk laser. The Disk laser has a cylindrical cavity, which
favors lasing of modes with high azimuthal (orbital) number. The fact
that this is a tunnel injection laser has an important modeling
implication. Since hot carriers are suppressed in the active region due
to tunnel injection directly to low energy bound states, the carrier
density in active region is predominantly fully 2 dimensional. Thus as
opposed to a conventional laser, the capture-escape model is not
necessary to dynamically couple the bound state density to bulk carriers
in the active region.
</p>
<p>
To model the optical response in the active region, the deck employs the
Luttinger-Kohn model k.p band structure model using the KP.CV2 parameter
on the MODELS statement. The quantum wells are treated as coupled. The
optical gain and spontaneous emission are computed using integration over
k-space. The integration can be activated by the KP.ADAPTIVE parameter on
MODELS statement. It is not activated by default in this example to reduce
simulation time.
</p>
<p>
The deck employs a 2D cylindrical vector Helmholtz solver to find
intensity and optical field distribution in R-Z plane of the cavity. The
orbital number is set by ORBIT parameter on the LASER statement. If a
range of orbital numbers is desired, set parameters ORB.MIN and ORB.MAX.
Metal electrodes are excluded from the solution domain by swtching off
HELMHOLTZ parameter on the REGION statement. Perfect Electric Conductor
boundary conditions are used at the boundaries of the domain.
</p>
<p>
Details of extraction of light from the cavity is not modeled here.
Instead, exctraction losses are set by parameter EXTR.LOSS [1/cm], which
is included in the photon rate equations. Mirror losses are kept at zero
by setting mirror reflectivities to 100% . Parameter PHOTON.ENERGY is
the initial guess for the cavity eigen mode&apos;s energy. The actual eigen
energies are printed on the screen, when parameter PRT.EVAL is specified
on the LASER statement.
</p>
<p>
The deck uses voltage boundary conditions throughout the simulation. The
voltage boundary conditions were found to provide better stability and
performance in the simulation.
</p>
<p>
The important modeling highlights are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 k.p bandstructure based calculation of gain and spontaneous
emission in the active region. The band structure is computed with
strain effects and full coupling to the electrostatic potential at every
bias step.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Multi-transverse  mode simulation of disk laser, with mode
competition
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Demonstration of a 2D vector Helmholtz solver for disk geometry
with full coupling to the changes in the complex refractive index due to
the gain computed from the k.p model, and free-carrier absorption from
the bulk carrier density in the device.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Tunnel injection modeled using a non-local tunneling junction. 
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The results show the total power emitted, modal photon density, gain and
loss of the lasing mode as a function of anode current. The family of
k.p gain and spontaneous emission spectra are shown at the sub-threshold
point of  micro Amps, near threshold, and above threshold. Flattening of
the electrostatic potential across the active region above threshold reduces
the energy differences between states localized in different wells.
This effect is clearly seen by comparing the valence bands at the
sub-threshold and above threshold points. The 2D plots optical intensity
above threshold show the spatial profile of the lasing mode.
