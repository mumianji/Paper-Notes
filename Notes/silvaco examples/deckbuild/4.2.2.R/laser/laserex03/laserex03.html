This example demonstrates simulation of a the  stripe geometry
GaAs/AlGaAs laser diode. Physically based frequency dependent optical
gain model is used in this example. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Laser structure definition using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Material parameters specification
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting conventional physical models
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Device initial biasing 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Activating LASER module of Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Mesh definition for solving the Helmholtz wave equation
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Definition of laser physical models and their parameters
including optical gain model
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calculation of laser electrical and optical characteristics
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In this example the same approach is applied to simulate a laser structure of
a different geometry and material composition. The active region of the
device under consideration represents a narrow stripe made of GaAs
included between two AlGaAs regions. The logistics of the structure,
material parameters and physical models definition repeat that of the
previous two examples in this section. Refer to those examples for
more detailed explanations.
</p>
<p>
After performing the LASER simulation and saving the results in the log and
structure output files, the following results are displayed in
TonyPlot:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Total light output power versus current 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Light intensity distribution over the structure
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Since stripe geometry lasers do not provide sufficient light confinement
in the direction parallel to the p-n- and heterojunction planes, the
lasing region
can be smeared laterally along the active region or shifted to a side
of the structure due to fluctuations in the carrier density and
dielectric permittivity. The latter may lead to the  spatial hole
burning effect and have a negative influence on the laser
characteristics. In this particular example spatial hole burning does
not occur, but the lack of index waveguiding in the lateral direction
which results in spreading the lasing area along the active region is
clearly visible.
