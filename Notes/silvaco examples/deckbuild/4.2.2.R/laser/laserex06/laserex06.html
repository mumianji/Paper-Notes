This example demonstrates the simulation of the buried heterostructure
InP/InGaAsP laser diode described earlier in example laserex02. A
description of the structure and the DC behaviour is contained in
example laserex02. This example performs a transient simulation of an
impulse applied to the anode contact of the laser diode.
</p>
<p>
The key points of this simulation are :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Mulit-longitudinal mode simulation
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Addition of laser losses of bulk absorption and free carrier loss
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 DC simulation to obtain the operating point at the lasing threshold
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Transient simulation response to a small impulse at the anode contact
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Resultant oscillation in simulated photon density
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The dynamic laser equations used in Atlas include the photon rate
equation as well as the equations for gain and spontaneous
recombination. This set of equations will be shown in this example to
reproduce the dynamic characteristics of relaxation oscillation.
</p>
<p>
The example described in laserex02 for DC characteristics of a laser
diode has been extended to examine the relaxation oscillations that
exist when a sudden impulse is applied to the anode contact. This
requires a transient simulation of the laser to reproduce these
oscillations. The physical origin of the oscillation is is based upon
the following principle: an increase in carrier density in the laser
(caused by the small impulse) will cause an increase in the calculated
gain which results in a rise in  the photon density inside the laser.
This increase in photon density causes an increase in the stimulated
recombination rate which decreases the carrier density, which causes
the photon density to fall, which causes the carrier density to rise,
and so on. An oscillatory process is therefore established which will
have some characteristic frequency and a characteristic damping time
constant.
</p>
<p>
This simulation uses the multi-longitudinal mode calculation, first
used in laserex02, in both the DC and transient parts of the
simulation. The final plots will illustrate how the laser emission
spectrum will change from the beginning to the end of the transient
simulation.
</p>
<p>
Four laser loss mechanisms have also been included; internal losses,
mirror loss, bulk absorption loss and free carrier loss. These
mechanisms have been activated with the parameters
<b> las.losses, </b> <b> las.mirror, </b> <b> las.absorption </b> and
<b> las.fcarrier. </b> </p>
<p>
The plot of the final logfile produced by the transient simulation will
plot the photon density versus time, and will show the oscillation
described previously.
