This example demonstrates the application of Laser to simulate a multi-quantum well laser diode. The key points of this simulation are :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 One mesh for both electrical and laser simulations
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Laser structure definition using new Atlas region syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Optical and electrical material parameters specification for the chosen materials
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Application of the QWELL parameter for active layer creation and quantum well simulation
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Use of LASER statement to define laser attributes
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 The same BLAZE mesh used for both electrical and laser simulations
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example is derived from published work [IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics,
VOL. 34, NO. 9, September 1998] and is reproduced as closely as possible in this simulation.
</p>
<b> Mesh Creation </b> <p>
The standard Atlas mesh
is used in both the electrical and laser parts of this simulation. If no specific laser mesh is created then Laser defaults to the standard Atlas mesh.
</p>
<b> Region Creation </b> <p>
The REGION statements are used to define many region quantities. The material type is defined with the
<b> material </b> parameter and the composition fractions within this material are set using the
<b> X.COMP </b> and
<b> Y.COMP </b> parameters appropriately.
</p>
<p>
The doping type and concentration are also defined on the region statement where the parameters
<b> acceptor </b> and
<b> donor </b> are used to define a uniform concentration in each region. If a non-uniform concentration is required then the DOPING statement would need to be used instead.
</p>
<b> Material Parameters </b> <p>
The
<b> material </b> statement is used to set various physical quantities for each material region in the device.
The band gap, conduction and valence band density of states and band alignment are declared with the parameters
<b> eg300, NC300, NV300 </b> and
<b> align. </b> The material permittivity for the solution of Poisson&apos;s equation and the high frequency bulk dielectric constant are both explicity set with the parameters
<b> permittivity </b> and
<b> epsinf. </b> Finally, the material lifetimes
<b> taun0 </b> and
<b> taup0 </b> and the constant of radiative recombination
<b> COPT </b> are defined.
</p>
<b> Quantum Wells (QWELL) </b> <p>
The
<b> qwell </b> parameter of the
<b> models </b> statement firstly creates new material region(s) that will contain the
quantum wells. Both the individual barrier width
<b> wb </b> and the quantum well width
<b> ww </b> need to be defined. Then a solution is found for bound state energies
in the quantum well by a solution to a coupled set of Poisson /
Schrodinger equations.
The solution to this equation is then used in the
<b> yan </b> model to calculate the optical gain of the quantum well.
</p>
<b> Laser and Physical Models </b> <p>
The physical models may be chosen from the manual as normal and in this
simulation there are 3 key models. The
<b> fermi </b> model is chosen to correctly simulate population inversion statistics
within the active region. The  laser gain model chosen for the active
regions is the multiple quantum well model chosen with the
<b> gainmod=4 </b> parameter. Finally the spontaneous recombination model
<b> optr </b> has been chosen to calculate the spontaneous recombination in the
device. The spontaneous recombination is used in the photon
rate equations to calculate the photon density.
</p>
<p>
The solution to the Helmholtz equation is controlled by parameters on the
<b> laser </b> statement. On this line the rear and front reflectivities can be
defined with the
<b> rf </b> and
<b> rr </b> parameters. The length of the laser cavity must be defined, so that the
longitudinal modes can be calculated correctly, using the
<b> cavity.length </b> parameter.
