<p>
At the beginning of the input file, the laser diode is described using Atlas
structural syntax including mesh, regions, electrodes and doping distributions
the same way as it is done for any conventional applications. The
<b> mesh </b> statement uses the
<b> diag.flip </b> parameter to make the mesh symmetrical with respect
to the vertical center cross section. The mesh symmetry reflects the
respective symmetry of the structure and may be important for
calculating correctly the
light intensity, local optical gain, and other internal physical distributions.
Mesh spacings are specified to resolve heterojunctions in x and y directions.
</p>
<p>
The laser structure is composed of 10 regions. The active lasing region
of the device is made of quaternary InGaAsP compound and surrounded by
InP regions of n- and p- type. All heterojunctions are modeled as
abrupt. The cathode electrode is defined in the center of the top of
the device. The anode electrode extends across the device at the
bottom. The composition parameters of the active region x.comp and
y.comp are defined in the respective
<b> region </b> statement.  The composition parameters are used to calculate
fundamental properties of the InGaAsP material. e.g. energy band gap,
dielectric constant,
densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, etc. using the
default dependencies. The default values of the above parameters are used
also for the InP regions.
</p>
<p>
Some other material parameters are specified in the
<b> material </b> statements separately for InP and InGaAsP materials. These include electron
and hole lifetimes (capture times) for the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination model,
optical recombination constants, and low field mobilities. In addition
the electron affinity for InGaAsP is explicitly defined to ensure
correct energy band alignment. The parameter gain1min describing local
optical gain and different from the default value is also given in the
<b> material </b> statement for InGaAsP.
</p>
<p>
In two
<b> models </b> statements a standard set of the Atlas/Blaze models is specified. In
order to save computational time no LASER specific models are defined
at this point. The LASER models are specified later in the input file
after the initial bias has been increased. According to theory no
laser emission will occur until the
difference of quasi-Fermi levels in the active layer exceeds the
material band gap. Therefore it is recommended to ramp the bias up to
some value not greater than the band gap of the active region, and then
enable the LASER models. In this example after obtaining the initial
solution the anode voltage is ramped up to 0.6 V in the two-carrier
solution mode.
</p>
<p>
The next part of the input file enables LASER specific models. It
starts from defining a mesh for solution of the Helmholtz wave
equation. The Helmholtz equation is solved on a uniform rectangular
mesh that is independent of the triangular mesh used for electrical
equations. The rectangular mesh and the region in which the Helmholtz
equation is solved is defined using the
<b> lx.mesh </b> and
<b> ly.mesh </b> statements. The defined region must lie completely inside the BLAZE
simulation domain and cover completely the active lasing region. The
conventional models and LASER specific models are specified in the
<b> models </b> statement. The LASER simulation is enabled by the parameter
<b> laser </b> in this statement. In this example the the  simple empirical gain model
is activated by the parameter
<b> gainmod=2 </b> . Here the optical gain is a function of electron and hole
concentrations given in the form of analytical expression with
empirical coefficients. The parameter
<b> las_maxch </b> specifies the maximum allowable relative change in the photon densities
between iterations. If not limited the rapid change in the photon
density may cause convergence problems. The parameter
<b> photon_energy </b> is used to specify the energy of the photons. If
<b> gainmod=2 </b> is used it specifies only an initial estimate of the photon energy.
Instead of
<b> photon_energy </b> the parameter las_omega can be used to define the
lasing frequency. The parameter
<b> cavity_length </b> specifies the cavity length in the 3rd z-direction. For other LASER
models and their parameters the default dependencies and values are
applied.
</p>
<p>
In the LASER mode the anode voltage is ramped up to 1.7V. The I-V,
light power, and total optical gain data, is saved in the log file. The
final physical distributions in the structure are saved in the output
structure file. The following results are visualized in TonyPlot:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Conventional I-V characteristic
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Light power versus current 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Optical gain versus current
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Light intensity distribution over the structure
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The behavior of the optical gain for the fundamental transverse mode
illustrates its increase until the current reaches the threshold value
and
then it remains flat equal to the light losses (in this case 30cm-1).
