This example demonstrates simulation of a buried heterostructure
InP/InGaAsP laser diode. A physically based frequency dependent optical
gain model is used in this example to calculate light emission
spectrum. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Laser structure definition using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting up the device models and initial biasing 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Activating LASER module of Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Mesh definition for solving the Helmholtz wave equation
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Definition of laser physical models and their parameters including the
<b> frequency dependent optical gain model</b> <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calculation of laser electrical and optical characteristics
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example illustrates how Atlas can be used to simulate
spectral characteristics. The spectral characteristics refer to the
longitudinal laser spectrum since LASER takes into account only the
fundamental transverse mode solution. It is known from the theory that
the longitudinal laser spectrum depends on the optical gain,
spontaneous emission spectrum, and the cavity length in the third
dimension (or Z-direction). A shorter cavity length leads to a wider
energy spacing
between adjacent longitudinal modes, and so fewer longitudinal modes
will be actually lasing. From the computational point of view the
situation of the nearly single mode laser operation is very desirable
because each lasing mode considered imposes an additional computational
burden.
</p>
<p>
For illustration purposes the structure under consideration is the same
as in the previous example in this section. We refer to that example
regarding the laser structure definition, mesh, material and physical
models specification.
</p>
<p>
The difference between this and the previous simulation is that
physically based optical gain modes are activated in LASER simulation
using the syntax
<b> models lmodes gainmod=1 </b> . Gainmod=1 sets the frequency dependent model.
The parameters
<b> las_einit las_efinal </b> are used to specify the photon energy range for spectral analysis, and the
<b> cavity_length </b> parameter is set to 50 microns. The latter value is rather small but it
allows us to demonstrate the spectral analysis within a comparatively
short run time.
</p>
<p>
As in the previous example the additional variables specified in the
<b> output </b> statement will be saved in the output structure file. These include the
conduction and valence band potentials for analyzing the energy band
diagram, total, SRH, Auger, and radiative recombination rates, and
current flowlines.
</p>
<p>
During simulation the IV data, light power, and total optical gain data is
stored in the log file. The laser spectra (gain spectra and photon
density spectra) are stored in separate log files for each bias
condition. The name of the spectrum log file is specified using the
parameter
<b> spec.name </b> in the
<b> models </b> statment in the LASER portion of the input file. The following results
are displayed in TonyPlot:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Total light output power versus current 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Gain spectra for different laser biases (currents) below and above lasing threshold  
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Light output spectrum below and above lasing threshold
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For comparison, the light output power vs diode current is shown along
with the similar data obtained in the previous example. The gain
saturation effect is
clearly seen after laser threshold. Only a few of the longitudinal
modes are actually lasing and the light output spectrum is practically
the same after the lasing threshold.
