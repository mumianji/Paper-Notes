This example describes how to simulate typical 10 GHz large signal measured
performance quantities related to power output, such as power out versus
power in, power gain and amplifier efficiency as the device is over-driven
into high distortion.  The example also plots the output signal shape versus
time for each of the ten input signal levels simulated.
</p>
<p>
Ten large signal input amplitudes are defined using
<b> WAVEFORM </b> statements.  Each of these waveforms are applied to the gate in order of
increasing amplitude by using the
<b> LOOP </b> statements. After each waveform simulation is complete, a number of
large signal parameters are calculated using a number of
<b> EXTRACT </b> statments.
</p>
<p>
First the peak input and output voltages are extracted, followed by the exact
times at which these peak voltages occurred.  Then the input and output
currents are extracted at the same times as the peak voltages occur.  It is
important to extract the currents at the same time as the peak voltages in
order to take account of the phase between current and voltage, so that the
correct power values can be calculated.  For example, if the current is zero
at the time the peak output voltage occurs, the calculated power is correctly
calculated to be also zero, since in this case the output signal would be
purely reactive.
</p>
<p>
After each waveform simulation, all the calculated quantities are entered into
a data file format using
<b> SYSTEM </b> statements.  At the end of the last simulation, the tonyplot format data file
is complete and the results are displayed as a number of plots.
