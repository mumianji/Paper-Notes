This example demonstrates the simulation of a GaN metal-insulator-semiconductor
field effect transistor (MISFET) with Piezo Neutralization Technique (PNT).
</p>
<p>
This example is based on the work of:
</p>
<p>
Ota, K. et. al. &quot;A Normally-off GaN FET with High Threshold Voltage
Uniformity Using A Novel Piezo Neutralization Technique&quot;, IEDM 2009, pp. 153-156.
</p>
<p>
The features of the PNT structure are described below and simulated with Blaze
</p>
<p>
The first feature is an AlGaN buffer layer to realize a
normally-off operation. The polarization charges at the interface
between the AlGaN buffer and the GaN channel act as virtual p-type
doping and contribute to simustaneously increase Vt and charge
density in the channel.The band diagram and IdVg simulations
demonstrate the impact of the buffer Al-concentration on the
electron-channel energy beneath the gate and Vth respectively
</p>
<p>
The second is an Al0.07Ga0.93N PNT layer having an identical
Al composition with the buffer layer to realize high Vth uniformity.
Since PNT and buffer layers have an identical Al mole fraction, the polarization charges formed between these layers are completely
canceled and hence, a flat band condition occurs throughout the PNT
layer. Vth dependence on the AlGaN layer thickness under the gate
electrode was simulated. For the GaN FETs with the PNT structure,
the Vth is not affected by the variation of AlGaN thickness whereas
it varies for the conventional Al0.15Ga0.85N/GaN single heterojunction
FETs.
</p>
<p>
The last is the 2nd supply layer at the region outside the gate
electrode to reduce on-resistance of the GaN FET. Since the 2nd
supply layer is consisted of AlGaN with higher Al composition than
that for the 1st supply layer, a large amount of 2DEG is produced
both in the channel layer and the PNT layer when enabling the
<b> POLARIZATION </b> model of the
<b> MODELS </b> statement. This polarization model accounts for the fact that a
layer may not have homogenous strain due to e.g. recessed gates
so polarization charge is calculated locally.
