This example demonstrates simulation of the &quot;Current Collapse&quot; and &quot;Current
Recovery&quot; phenomenon resulting from population and de-population of
both un-intentional insulator interface traps and intentional iron (Fe)
traps near and under the gate of the GaN FET as a result of Gate to Drain
Electric Fields.
</p>
<p>
The device structure in this example is based on work by Daniel Balaz from
his PhD Thesis from University of Glasgow in 2011 entitled &quot;Current collapse
and device degradation in AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field effect transistors&quot;
</p>
<p>
The structure is created using Atlas syntax and the spontaneous and piezo-
electric charge concentrations are automatically calculated using the
&quot;substrate, polarization and calc.strain&quot; parameters in the region statements.
</p>
<p>
Substrate leakage current is controlled by a graduated concentration of
deep level iron (Fe) acceptor traps located 1eV below the conduction band
edge using the doping statement and the key parameter &quot;trap&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The insulator interface traps are created using the &quot;inttrap&quot; statement.
For analytical simplicity, only a single level interface acceptor trap,
located 0.8eV below the conduction band edge was used.
The areal density of the interface traps used in this example, was 2e12/cm2.
Using a different energy location in the bandgap for the intentional Fe
doping and the un-intentional insulator interface traps, allowed the
contribution from both types of trap to be distinguished on the resulting
transient I-V curves.
</p>
<p>
The device is first biased with zero volts on the gate and 5 volts
on the drain. After 1 mili-second at this bias, the device is field stressed
for only one further milli-second at 25 volts on the drain
and -4 volts on the gate. After this short bias stress,
the device was returned to it&apos;s original bias of
zero volts on the gate and 5 volts on the drain.
</p>
<p>
After only one milli-second of bias stress, the drain current is
significantly reduced demonstrating the currnet collapse phenomenon.
For completeness, the unstressed bias remained on the device until the traps
became de-populated with electrons and the drain current returned to it&apos;s
original value.  Interestingly, it takes over one week for the device to
recover !  (6e5 seconds).  This very long recovery time may be incorrectly
interpreted as device degredation from field induced traps which is an
irreversible effect resulting from electric field induced
reverse piezo-electric stress.
</p>
<p>
It will be seen from the transient recovery curve that there are two recovery
&apos;bumps&quot;.  The first current recovery &quot;bump&quot; at a time of around 30 seconds,
is from the re-population of the interface traps and the main recovery at
approximately 1e5 seconds, is from the intentionally doped bulk iron (Fe)
traps.  Obviously a wide distribution of insulastor interface trap energies
will &quot;smear out&quot; this initial recovery bump making it difficult to
distinguish this individual contribution from the bulk iron traps.  That is
why a single interface trap energy was selected for this example to clarify
the effect on the current recovery curve.
