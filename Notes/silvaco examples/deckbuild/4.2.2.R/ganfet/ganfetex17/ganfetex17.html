This example demonstrates Id-Vds and Id-Vgs simulations for a 2D and 3D
AlGaN/GaN HEMT.
</p>
<p>
This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the heterojunction structure using Victory Device syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Material and models parameter specification 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of Id/Vds and Id/Vgs characteristics 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Display of the results in TonyPlot and TonyPlot 3D
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
By default Victory Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot; </b> could be specidied in the
<b> go </b> line starting Victory Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
The device under consideration is a AlGaN/GaN HEMT. The main concept here
is that the polarization charge is calculated using the
built-in models as specified by the
<b> POLARIZATION </b> parameter on the
<b> MODEL </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
After the initial solution is obtained, the gate voltage is ramped from 0V
to -7.6 V to get the IdVg characteristic at Vd=1 V.
</p>
<p>
A family of drain current characteristics are then simulated with
lattice heating taken into account by ramping the drain from 0 to 15 V
at various gate voltages.
</p>
<p>
Since the width of the 3D device is set to 1um a direct comparison with 2D
results is possible for validation purpose.
