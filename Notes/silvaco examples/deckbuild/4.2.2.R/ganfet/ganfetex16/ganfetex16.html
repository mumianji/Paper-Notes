Field plate (FP) technologies are generally used in order to manage surface electric
field distribution of GaN HEMTs. Recently, GaN Super Heterojunction Field Effect
Transistors (Super HFETs) based on the polarization junction (PJ) concept have been
demonstrated [1, 2]. This concept is based on the compensation of positive and negative
polarization charges at heterointerfaces such as AlGaN/GaN to achieve similar effect
to RESURF or Super Junction (SJ) in silicon devices. In this example, we will
demonstrate device simulation of GaN Super HFETs in comparison with the experimental
data based on [1, 2].
</p>
<p>
The Super HFET structure consists of an undoped double-hetero GaN/AlGaN/GaN structure
with a p-GaN cap layer. The feature of the Super HFET structure is the presence of
the 2-D hole gas (2DHG) induced by negative polarization charge at the upper GaN/AlGaN
heterointerface as well as the 2-D electron gas (2DEG) at the lower AlGaN/GaN heterointerface.
The computation of 2DEG and 2DHG due to polarization effect was performed automatically
during the simulation with our built-in model and can be seen in tonyplot.
</p>
<p>
Performance of GaN device and convergence can be significantly influenced by the presence
of defects. We introduced bulk and interface traps in the simulation. Threshold voltage
and substrate leakage current are controlled by a concentration of acceptor and donor
traps in the GaN buffer layer, respectively. Moreover, we put the interface traps to
represent Fermi level pinning at the bottom of the GaN buffer. This assumption is properly
valid because an actual GaN epitaxial layer has quite many defects around the interface
with the substrate. It should be noticed that even with traps and a floating undoped-GaN
buffer region convergence is very ggod.
</p>
<p>
The simulation results of the Id-Vg and Id-Vd characteristics can be seen in tonyplot.
Very good agreement between simulations and experiments were obtained.
</p>
<p>
Breakdown characteristics and impact ionization rate distribution is also shown in tonyplot
and were simulated by using slow transient simulation. An increase of the gate current
(including the base current) is observed near breakdown and the value is of the same order
as the drain current. In addition, it should be noticed that impact ionization occurs near
the drain-side edge of p-GaN region. These results indicate that breakdown voltage is
dominated by the hole current into the base electrode through the p-GaN layer.
