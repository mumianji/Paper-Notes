This example demonstrates how to simulate a GaN HFET with p-type GaN gate
and is based on the following paper:

<p>
While a Schottky-type metal on the AlGaN barrier acts as gate for normally-on
HEMTs, a p-type doped semiconductor as gate is able to deplete the transistor
channel when unbiased, thus yielding a normally-off device. The simulation of
the transfert characteristic reveals a Vt of around 1.25V.
</p>
<p>
The sub-threshold leakage current drops significantly immediately below the
threshold voltage, however the drop slows down to around 4uA/mm at VGS=0V.
The leakage current is determined by traps.
</p>
<p>
The gate current in the on-state (defined as VGS=5V) is around 3uA/mm and
thus around 5 orders of magnitude below the drain current. In order to ensure
that the charge are present at the interface between p-type GaN, AlGaN and Nitride the
<b> PCH.INS REGION=5 </b> parameters of the
<b> MODELS </b> statement are used.
</p>
<p>
The output characteristic shows a negative differential resistance due
to lattice heating and simulated by solving the lattice heating equation
set by the
<b> LAT.TEMP </b> parameter of the
<b> MODELS </b> statement. The maximum drain current is about 0.4A/mm.
</p>
<p>
The Breakdown Voltage of thisdevice is 870V, and the leakage current
is controlled by the traps.
