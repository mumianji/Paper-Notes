This example demonstrates the interaction between polarization charges,
surface states, cap layer thickness and Al composition in AlGaN/GaN HFETs.
</p>
<p>
By default Victory Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot; </b> could be specidied in the
<b> go </b> line starting Victory Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
The input deck vdex06.in uses dbinternal to obtain the channel charge density
(i.e 2DEG) for each of the saved structure files.  It does this using the file
vdex06_aux_0.in and vdex06_aux_1.in. The advantage of using dbinternal is that
the data file containing the charge densities can be plotted using
<b> TonyPlot</b> .
These charge densities are plotted  against the cap layer thickness and Al
composition in AlGaN Cap layer.
</p>
<p>
The input deck containing the actual description of the devices is found in
ganfetex01_aux_0.in and ganfetex01_aux_0.in.
</p>
<p>
Victory device is a 2D and 3D device simulator.In this example we demonstrate
the use of Victory Device in 2D mode.
</p>
<p>
The Victorydevice input deck consists of the following parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the device and the grid using victorydevice syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of material regions
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 models, interface charge and interface trap parameters
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Extraction of the 2DEG. 
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In the first part of the input deck (ganfetex01_aux_0.in) the device is described
using Victorydevice syntax, including mesh, regions and electrodes locations.
The
<b> REGION </b> statements are used to define AlGaN and GaN regions. The Al composition
fraction (x.composition=0.27) is defined here as well.
After the device description, the
<b> MODEL </b> statement is used to specify the built-in polarization model set by specifying
<b> POLARIZATION </b> for spontaneous polarization and
<b> CALC.STRAIN </b> for piezoelectric polarization.
<b> PCH.INS and PCH.ELEC </b> are set in order to allow charges at the interface between AlGaN and Oxide
(pch.ins) and between GaN and conductor at the bottom of the structure (pch.elec).
</p>
<p>
Next the
<b> SOLVE </b> statement is used to obtain a zero biased solution.  The
<b> SAVE </b> statement is used to save this solution for perform extraction of the 2DEG.
</p>
<p>
In the second part of the input deck we do the same simulation but instead
of using the built-in polarization model that calculate the polarization charges
as a function of composition, strain and lattice constant for the various materials,
we set polarization charges directly using the
<b> INTERFACE CHARGE=</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
2DEG simulation results using the built-in polarization model, manually added
charges and measurement taken from the dissertation &quot;High voltage GaN HEMTs with
low on-resistance for switching  applications&quot; written by Naiqian Zhang UNIVERSITY
of CALIFORNIA Santa Barbara September 2002 are compared and show good correlation.
</p>
<p>
The built-in polarization model being validated, it can be used to perform the same
simulation but instead of making variation of cap layer thickness, Al composition
is used instead (ganfetex18_aux_1.in). As expected 2DEG increases with Al composition.
