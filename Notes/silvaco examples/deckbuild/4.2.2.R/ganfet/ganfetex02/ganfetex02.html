This example demonstrates simulation of avalanche breakdown an
AlGaN/GaN HEMT. It
</p>
<p>
This example is based on the paper:
</p>
<p>
Karmalkar and Mishra &quot;Enhancement of Breakdown Voltage in AlGaN/GaN
High Electron Mobility Transistors Using a Field Plate&quot;, ED 48, No. 8,
pp 1515-1521,  August 2001.
</p>
<p>
At the outermost level, the simulation uses the DeckBuild looping and
variable assignment capabilities of LOOP, L.END and SET.   Near the
end of the input deck, the simulation again uses the built-in capabilities
of DeckBuild to perform complex parameter extraction using the EXTRACT
statements.
</p>
<p>
This Atlas part of the example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the heterojunction structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Material and models parameter specification 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of Id-Vds and breakdown characteristic 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Display of the results in TonyPlot

</ul>
<p>
The device under consideration consists of a simple 0.4 micron gate length
GaN HEMT augmented with a field plate used to increase the breakdown
voltage.  This simulation loops on increasing field plate lengths to
examine the relationship between field plate geometry and breakdown
voltage.
</p>
<p>
In the first part of the input file, the device is described using
the Atlas structural syntax. The description includes the mesh, regions
locations, electrodes locations, and doping distribution.
The
<b> region </b> statements are used to define the AlGaN and GaN regions. The Al
composition fraction (x.composition=0.295) is defined here as well.
</p>
<p>
After the device description,
<b> material </b> statement are used to define the characteristics of the various materials
used in the simulation.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> models </b> statements are used to specify the following set of models : field
dependent mobility, SRH recombination  and Fermi-Dirac statistics.
</p>
<p>
In order to simulate avalanche breakdown, the impact ionization-generation model
should be turned on. This is done using the
<b> impact selb </b> statement in which the Selberherr impact ionization model is activated.
All basic impact ionization parameters are user-accessible and can be
modified by the user.
</p>
<p>
The gate electrode in HEMT structures is a Schottky contact. This is specified
by using the
<b> contact </b> statement to define the workfunction of the gate electrode.
</p>
<p>
Here the
<b> beam </b> statement is used to specify an optical source of carrier pair generation
in addition to the thermal generation provided by SRH.  This is generally a
good strategy for analyzing breakdown especially in wide bandgap materials
or at low temperatures to improve convergence.  This is not recommended when
estimating sub-breakdown diode leakage currents though.
</p>
<p>
Next the drain voltage is ramped to 1200 volts.  At that point the
drain boundary is changed to a current boundary using the
<b> contact current </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
This is performed to improve convergence up throught the breakdown portion
of the curve where current is changing much faster than voltage.
