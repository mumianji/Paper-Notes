The device structure in this example is based on the work from Yasuhiro Uemoto
published at IEDM 2006 &quot;A Normally-off AlGaN/GaN Transistor with Ron=2.6mOhmcm2
and BVds=640V Using Conductivity Modulation&quot;
</p>
<p>
This example demonstrates simulation of a normally-off AlGaN/GaN transistor
with conductivity modulation resulting from hole injection from a p-AlGaN
gate to the AlGaN/GaN heterojunction. The p-AlGaN gate allows normally-off
operation.
</p>
<p>
When the gate voltage increases and reaches the built-in pn junction
voltage at the gate (around 3.5V here) hole starts to inject into the channel
and generate the equal number of electrons increasing the 2DEG. Electrons with
high mobility will reach the drain under the effect of the electric field
whereas the hole will stay since their mobility is much lower than the
electron. The current is thus modulated by the number of holes injected.
It is also interesting to notice that this device exhibit a double peak
in the transconductance curve a second proof of hole injection.
</p>
<p>
Electrons injection from the channel to the gate is limited by the AlGaN/GaN
heterojunction. As a consequence no current offset is observed at zero drain
since gate current is very low.
</p>
<p>
This device exhibit a threshold voltage around 1V, a maximum drain current at
vd=10V and Vg=5V of 200mA/mm and a breakdown voltage of 640V.
