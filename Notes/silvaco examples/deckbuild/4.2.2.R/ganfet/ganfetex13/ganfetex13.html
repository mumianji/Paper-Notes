This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the 3D heterojunction structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 3D Stress simulation, Material and models parameter specification 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 3D Simulation of Id/Vgs characteristics and comparison with 2D for validation
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The device under consideration is a 3D AlGaN/GaN HEMT. The 2D structure is first
obtained by Athena and then extruded in 3D using DEVEDIT. This is in fact the structure
created in ganfetex05.  3D stress distribution is simulated by VICTORYSTRESS.
This example produces stress distributions via the stress-liner made of nitride.
Note that the stressor in this example is used to illustrate strain polarization,
on top of lattice and spontaneous polarization.
</p>
<p>
The polarization model that supports dependency on loaded strain tensor
has been used in this example. The model is enabled by the
<b> POLARIZATION </b> flag of the
<b> MODELS </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The main concept of GaN based power devices is to use epitaxial strain to create
2DEG. The polarization model that supports epitaxial strain due to lattice
mismatch is enabled by the
<b> CALC.STRAIN </b> flag on the
<b> MODEL </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
When both models are set in the simulation both the imported strain and the
lattice mismatch calculation are accounted for.
</p>
<p>
The lattice and imported strain dependent components of polarization can
be independently scaled using the scale factors
<b> TENSO.SCALE </b> and
<b> PIEZO.SCALE </b> on the
<b> MODEL </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
When enabling the
<b> POLARIZATION </b> flag spontaneous polarization is automatically included in the calculation.
The size of the spontaneous component can be scaled using the
<b> PSP.SCALE </b> parameter of the
<b> MODELS </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
After the initial solution is obtained the drain voltage is ramped to 1 V,
then the IdVg characteristic is extracted from Vg=-8 to Vg=1.0 V.
</p>
<p>
The effect of strain is seen on IdVg characteristic. Overlay of 2D simulation
results with 3D simulation results obtained with width=1 validates our 3D
implementation.
