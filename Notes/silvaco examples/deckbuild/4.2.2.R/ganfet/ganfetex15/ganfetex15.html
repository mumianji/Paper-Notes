This example demonstrates the influence of the Gate to Drain distance on the
breakdown voltage with and without silicon substrate. This example is based on
the following reference
</p>
<p>
Experimental and simulation study of breakdown voltage enhancement of AlGaN/gaN
heterostructures by Si substrate removal. D.Visalli et al Apl. Phys. Lett. 97, 113501 2010.
</p>
<p>
The structure consists of 20nm AlGaN with xcomp=0.2 and 1um GaN buffer layer.
Donor and acceptor traps are included in the simulation. Gaussian profile
acceptor traps are used with a peak concentration close to the bottom of the
buffer layer to mimic the fact that the material quality improves toward
the surface of the device.
</p>
<p>
Donor Interface traps at the AlGaN/Nitride interface and acceptor interface
traps at the GaN/Silicon interface are also included during the simulation.
</p>
<p>
Forward charateristic simulation reveals a threshold voltage of around -2V.
Slow transient simulation is used to simulate the breakdown voltage curve.
</p>
<p>
The deck is parametrized so that we can make variation of the distance between
gate and drain (LGD). Deckbuild DoE capability is used to automate simulations
of BV versus LGD with and without substrate.
</p>
<p>
We can observe in tonyplot an almost linear increase of BV versus LGD when silicon
substrate is not present. An increase of the gate current is observed near breakdown
and the value is of the same order as the drain current. This result indicates
that BV is defined by an avalanche phenomenon between the gate and the drain.
</p>
<p>
BV does not depend significantly on LGD when silicon substrate is present due to
charge accumulation at the GaN/Silicon interface, related to the presence of interface
traps, which screen the electric field. During the simulation and for comparison
purpose, a resistance is added to the substrate so that the current leakage through
the substrate is reduced. Note that if no resistance is added to the substrate
an increase of the substrate current is observed near breakdown and the value is
of the same order as the drain current. This result indicates that BV is defined
by an avalanche phenomenon between the gate and the substrate in this case.
