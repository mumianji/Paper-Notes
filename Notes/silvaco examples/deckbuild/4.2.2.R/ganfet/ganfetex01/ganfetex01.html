This example demonstrates the interaction between polarization charges,
surface states and cap layer thickness in AlGaN/GaN HFETs.
</p>
<p>
This example was the basis for the Simulation Standard article
&quot;Simulating the Source of Polarization Charge in AlGaN/GaN HFETs&quot;
Simulation Standard, V. 15, N. 8, Aug. 2006, Silvaco International.
</p>
<p>
This article and example are based on the work of:
J. P. Ibbetson, et. al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 77, 250 (2000).
</p>
<p>
The input deck ganfetex01.in uses dbinternal to obtain the channel
charge density for each of the saved structure files.  It does this using
the file ganfetex01_aux.in. The advantage of using dbinternal is that the
data file containing the charge densities can be plotted using
TonyPlot. These charge densities are plotted against the cap layer thickness.
</p>
<p>
The input deck containing the actual description of the devices is
contained in ganfetex01_aux.in.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas specification consists of the following parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the device and the grid using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of material regions
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Definition of electrodes and doping
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Material, models, interface charge and interface trap parameters
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of Id-Vds characteristic 
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In the first part of the input file the device is described using Atlas
syntax including mesh, regions and electrodes locations, and doping distribution.
The
<b> region </b> statements are used to define AlGaN and GaN regions. The Al composition
fraction (x.composition=0.34)is defined here as well.
After the device description, the
<b> material </b> statement is used to specify some of the material parameters different from
the default values. Whenever any of the default values of material parameters
or models are questioned you should specify the parameter values manually.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> model </b> statement is used to specify the following set of models: field dependent
mobility, and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, Fermi-Dirac statistics, and
incomplete ionization.
</p>
<p>
Next the interface characteristics are specified.  In particular the
polarization charges and surface traps are specified.  We could have
used the built-in polarization models that calculate the polarization
charges as a function of composition, strain and lattice constant for
the various materials, but in this case we are specifying polarization
charges directly to simplify calibration to the data presented in the paper.
</p>
<p>
Next the
<b> solve </b> statement is used to obtain a zero biassed solution.  The
<b> save </b> statement is used to save this solution for subsequent examination in
TonyPlot.  TonyPlot is used to look at the channel electron
charge as a function of cap layer thicknress.
