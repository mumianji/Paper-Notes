This example demonstrates simulation of the &quot;Current Collapse&quot; and &quot;Current
Recovery&quot; phenomenon resulting from population and de-population of
Intentional Iron (Fe) Doping Traps under the gate of a GaN FET as a result
of Gate to Drain Electric Fields.
</p>
<p>
Many publications suggest that un-intentional surface traps are the main cause
of the GaN current collapse phenomenon.  In this example, we show that
sometimes this is not actually the case.  Current collapse in this device, is
mostly caused by intentional iron doping, whose main purpose is to create a
semi-insulating buried layer to reduce the buried layer source to drain
leakage path.
</p>
<p>
The device structure in this example is based on work by Daniel Balaz from his
PhD Thesis from University of Glasgow in 2011 entitled &quot;Current collapse and
device degradation in AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field effect transistors&quot;
</p>
<p>
The structure is created using Atlas syntax and the spontaneous and piezo-
electric charge concentrations are automatically calculated using the
&quot;substrate, polarization and calc.strain&quot; parameters in the region statements.
</p>
<p>
Substrate leakage current is controlled by a graduated concentration of
deep level iron acceptor traps located 1eV below the conduction band edge
using the doping statement and the key parameter &quot;trap&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The device is first biased with zero volts on the gate and 5 volts
on the drain. After 1 mili-second at this bias, the device is field stressed
for only one further milli-second at 25 volts on the drain
and -4 volts on the gate. After this short bias stress,
the device was returned to it&apos;s original bias of
zero volts on the gate and 5 volts on the drain.
After only one milli-second of bias stress, the drain current is
significantly reduced demonstrating the currnet collapse phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
A comparason structure file plot of the pre and post stress ionized Fe trap
density, shows the cause of the current collapse is actually the change in
charge state of the Fe doping deep in the substrate under the gate and
also on the drain side between the gate and drain contacts.
</p>
<p>
For completeness, the unstressed bias remained on the device until the traps
became de-populated with electrons and the drain current returned to it&apos;s
original value.  Interestingly, it takes over one week for the device to
recover !  (6e5 seconds).  This very long recovery time may be incorrectly
interpreted as device degredation from field induced traps which is an
irreversible effect resulting from electric field induced
reverse piezo-electric stress.
