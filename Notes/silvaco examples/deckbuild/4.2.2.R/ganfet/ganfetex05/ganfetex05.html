<p>
The device under consideration is a simple AlGaN/GaN HEMT. The 2D structure is
obtain by Athena and the stress distribution is simulated by VICTORYSTRESS.
This example produces stress distributions via the stress-liner made of nitride
(tensile or compressive). Note that the stressor in this example is used to
illustrate strain polarization, on top of lattice and spontaneous polarization.
</p>
<p>
The polarization model that supports dependency on loaded strain tensor
has been used in this example. The model is enabled by the
<b> POLARIZATION </b> flag of the
<b> MODELS </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The main concept of GaN based power devices is to use epitaxial strain to create
2DEG. The polarization model that supports epitaxial strain due to lattice
mismatch is enabled by the
<b> CALC.STRAIN </b> flag on the
<b> MODEL </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
When both models are set in the simulation both the imported strain and the
lattice mismatch calculation are accounted for.
</p>
<p>
The lattice and imported strain dependent components of polarization can
be independently scaled using the scale factors
<b> TENSO.SCALE </b> and
<b> PIEZO.SCALE </b> on the
<b> MODEL </b> statement. By default these are set to 1.0.
</p>
<p>
When enabling the
<b> POLARIZATION </b> flag spontaneous polarization is automatically included in the calculation.
The size of the spontaneous component can be scaled using the
<b> PSP.SCALE </b> parameter of the
<b> MODELS </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
After the initial solution is obtained the drain voltage is ramped to 1 V,
then the IdVg characteristic is extracted from Vg=-5 to Vg=1.0 V.
</p>
<p>
The effect of strain is seen on IdVg characteristic. For illustration purpose
we combined, in this example, different intrinsic stress (compressive or tensile)
leading to different stress distribution and sign in the channel and the source
and drain region. As a result IdVg curves change accordingly.
