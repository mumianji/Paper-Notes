This example demonstrates the simulation of stresses in a test MOSFET structure with
embedded anSiGe layer. The simulated process includes epitaxial growth of thin
compressed SiGe and relaxed silicon layers. The standard gate stack is then emulated by
gate oxide and poly deposition and oxide spacer formation.  All important geometrical
characterisics of the test structure, including thicknesses of different layers, spacer width, gate length, etc.,
are parametrized. This allows us to investigate the effects of parameter
variations on important device characteristics using either DBInternal capability of Deckbuild or Virtual Wafer Fab (VWF).
The set values of all parameters approximately correspond to those used
to simulate Figs. 2. and 3 in
<b> [1]</b> .
</p>
<p>
The most important step of this test process is etching of the source/drain areas because
it creates free surfaces on the sides of the buried SiGe layer. This step results in
elastic expansion of the buried layer, reducing the compressive stress inside the
layer and generating tensile stress in silicon above, i.e. under the gate. This
enhanced tensile stress affects carrier transport and effectively improves device
characteristics. The stresses in the whole structure are  calculated before and after the S/D etch.
</p>
<p>
The results of the calculation are plotted using
<b> TonyPlot </b> to display 2D contours of the XX component of stress in the final structure. The second plot compares stress profiles (obtained by
<b> Extract ... curve</b> statements and measured in MPa) through the center of the gate before and after the S/D etch step.
</p>
<p>
The series of
<b> Extract</b> statements calculate the average stresses under the gate. The first 2 extract statements estimate
average stress at specified depth under the gate. Next 2 extract statements estimate
average stress inside a box under the gate.
</p>
<p>
The last extract statement calculates the important figure of merit of this
process, i.e. the stress transfer efficiency (STE) specified as absolute value of
the ratio between the average stresses under the gate and initial stress in the SiGe
buried layer.
