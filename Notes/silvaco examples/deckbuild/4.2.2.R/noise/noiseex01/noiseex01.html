This example shows a Noise
simulation in Atlas.
</p>
<p>
A 10k n-type silicon resistor is modeled, and a DC_IV sweep is performed
to confirm the resistance.
</p>
<p>
The noise generated by a device is modeled by taking an ideal
(noiseless) device and adding a random voltage source to each port.
For a one port device we have a single noise voltage source.  The
noise behavior is described by the statistical nature of these
voltage sources.  The mean value of the voltage from the source is
zero and so the noise is described by the autocorrelation of the
voltage source &lt;v^2&gt;.
</p>
<p>
Noise is an extension of the usual ac analysis of a device: a noise
simulation can be performed on any device on which ac analysis can be
performed.  On the
<b> log </b> command we have to define which contact is the principle for the
<b> inport </b> and we have to add the keyword
<b> noise.v </b> to tell Atlas to calculate the statistical properties of the noise
voltage sources.
</p>
<p>
On the
<b> solve </b> command we use the
<b> noise.ss </b> keyword to tell Atlas to calculate the noise over the defined
frequency range.  N.b. the
<b> direct </b> method must be used when calculating the noise.
</p>
<p>
The Nyquist theorem gives the expected noise generated by a resistor
as &lt;v^2&gt;=4kTR, where k is Boltzmann&apos;s constant, T is the temperature
of the resistor, and R is the resistance.  For a 10k resistor at 300K
this gives &lt;v^2&gt;=1.657e-16 V^2/Hz which agrees well with the result of
the simulation.
