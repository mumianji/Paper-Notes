This example shows that the noise generated by a device comes from
several sources.
</p>
<p>
A pn silicon diode is modeled, and a DC-IV sweep is performed to confirm
the nature of the diode.
</p>
<p>
The procedure for calculating the noise is almost the same as in the
first example.  However, this time we use the keyword
<b> noise.v.all </b> on the
<b> log</b> command.  This tells Atlas to output the individual noise from
different sources as well as the total noise.
</p>
<p>
The final plot shows the total noise is the sum of the noise from
three sources: electron diffusion, hole diffusion, and
generation-recombination.
</p>
<p>
The noise from electron diffusion and hole diffusion is always
calculated.  If any generation-recombination models are defined (
<b> srh, optr, auger</b> ) then GR noise is automatically calculated.
</p>
<p>
In addition to these noise sources there are two additional sources:
electron and hole flicker (1/f) noise.  The exact physical origin of
flicker noise is not fully known, so Atlas uses the phenomenological
Hooge model.
