This example investigates the noise generated by a two-port device.
</p>
<p>
A silicon MOSFET is modeled and a DC-IV sweep is performed to get to
an operating bias point.
</p>
<p>
The noise generated by the two-port is modeled as a voltage source on
each port of the device: v1 and v2.  The mean of each source is zero
and the noise is described by the second order statistical properties
of the voltage sources: &lt; v1.v1* &gt;, &lt; v2.v2* &gt; and &lt; v1.v2* &gt;.  The
auto-correlations are real numbers but the cross-correlation is
complex.  So four real numbers are required to describe the noise
behavior of a two-port device.
</p>
<p>
For a two-port the noise is also described by a set of Figures of
Merit: the minimum noise figure, the optimum source impedance and the
noise conductance.  The noise figure is a measure of the extra noise
that the device adds to the signal reaching the load, it is defined as
</p>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>
 F = Psd / Ps.
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Psd is the noise power delivered to the load by the noisy source and
the noisy device.  Ps is the noise power that would be delivered to
the load if the source were noisy but the device was ideal.  The
optimum source impedance is the impedance which gives the minimum
noise figure.  The noise conductance is a measure of how the noise
figure increases as the source impedance moves away from the optimum.
</p>
<p>
For a two-port device we need to set the
<b> inport </b> and the
<b> outport </b> on the
<b> log </b> command.  Again the
<b> noise.v </b> command is used to tell Atlas to calculate the noise.
</p>
<p>
Because noise is an extension of the normal ac analysis the
<b> noise.ss xs </b> command on the solve statement will automatically calculate any ac
parameters defined  on the
<b> log </b> statement (such as the
<b> z.param </b> in this example).
