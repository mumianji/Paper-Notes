This example shows the ability of the advanced diffusion model to handle
<b> Interstitial Cluster (IC) </b> kinetics.
</p>
<p>
In order to validate the IC model, we simulate the experimental data obtained by
<b> Cowern et al</b> .
This experiment consists of observing the diffusivity of two boron marker layers after a silicon implantation at 40 keV to a dose of
2E13 atoms/cm^2. From these observations, Cowern has estimated the diffusion enhancement
and the evolution of Interstitial supersaturation with time.
From the experimental  point of view, this quantity can be related to the
<b> boron diffusion enhancement </b> with respect to its thermal equilibrium diffusion.
</p>
<p>
The surpersaturation evolution curve exhibits three parts:
</p>
<b> 1. </b> <p>
The first step characterized by a high supersaturation value (first run of the simulation) corresponds
to a large acceleration of the dopant diffusion and can be explained by the presence of
<b> small clusters</b> .
</p>
<b> 2. </b> <p>
The second step, exhibits a plateau slightly decreasing with time. It is explained by the competitive growth between {311}
defects, known as the
<b> Ostwald ripening </b> phenomena. Diffusion acceleration remains constant during this plateau.
</p>
<b> 3. </b> <p>
The third step, characterized by the supersaturation collapse, is explained by the
<b> entire dissolution </b> of the Interstitial Cluster population due to the recombination at the surface.
</p>
<p>
In order to represent two boron markers obtained by epitaxy in Cowern&apos;s experiment, two implants with calibrated moments are used in the example. The initial interstitial profile generated
by the silicon implant in the experiment is implemented into simulation by the PROFILE statement with the advdifex02.dat file.
</p>
<p>
To activate the new advanced diffusion model, specify
<b> PLS IC </b> in the
<b> METHOD </b> statement before the diffusion step, to take into account both Classical Dopant Diffusion (CDD) and IC models.
