Once the validity of the entire
<b> PLS </b> diffusion model has been proved using specific experiments, simulations of relevant modern silicon technologies are considered.
</p>
<p>
Boron implantation at
<b> 20 keV </b> is widely used  in silicon technologies. Since the experiment setup involves low temperature such as 800C,
the effects of boron immobilization and desactivation at high concentration take place. Thus, the three
parts of the PLS model have to be used.
</p>
<p>
A comparison between
<b> chemical </b> and
<b> electrically active </b> boron concentration shows that
even below the solid solubility, most of the dopant stay inactive due to the formation of mixed
dopant-defect clusters
<b> (BIC) </b> at high concentrations. By comparing resuls obtained with only CDD or IC model with the full PLS (IC + DDC), it can
be concluded that this type of
cluster also consumes free interstitials which leads to
<b> reduction </b> of the boron  diffusion.
</p>
<p>
This proves one more time that all three parts of the model: classical, interstitial clusters, and mixed dopant-defect
clusters,  are needed to accurately simulate the
post-implant diffusion.
</p>
<p>
The initial
<b> interstitial </b> profile generated by the boron implant is modeled though a &quot;+1&quot; model.
</p>
<p>
To activate the new advanced diffusion model, specify
<b> PLS IC DDC </b> in the
<b> METHOD </b> statement before the diffusion step to take into account CDD, IC and BIC models.
