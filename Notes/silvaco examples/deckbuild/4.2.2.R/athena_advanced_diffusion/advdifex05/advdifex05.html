Once the validity of entire
<b> PLS </b> diffusion model has been proved using specific experiments, simulations of relevant modern integrated
circuits technologies are addressed.
</p>
<p>
A most aggressive technology simulation has been carried out, with a
<b> 2 keV </b> boron implant with a dose of 1E14 atoms/cm^2 followed by a
<b> RTA </b> at 1000C during 10 seconds. This type of simulation is difficult because it needs to take into account
a large number of phenomena including
<b> defect recombination </b> at the surface, and the fact that TED duration is a function of the implant setup and subsequent diffusion duration. Despite
these difficulties, the model exhibits an excellent behavior with regard to experimental annealed data which proves its relevance.
</p>
<p>
The initial
<b> interstitial </b> profile generated by the boron implant is modeled though a &quot;+1&quot; model.
</p>
<p>
To activate the new advanced diffusion model, specify
<b> PLS IC DDC </b> in the
<b> METHOD </b> statement before the diffusion step to take into account CDD, IC and BIC models.
