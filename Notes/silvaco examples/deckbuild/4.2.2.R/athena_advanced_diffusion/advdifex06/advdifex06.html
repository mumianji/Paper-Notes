To illustrate the improvements that result from an
<b> advanced diffusion model</b> , we show simulations of phosphorus predeposition profiles at high and intermediate concentrations. The
simulation results are compared to the SIMS data of Yoshida and Matsumoto.  This
experiment is representative of high dopant concentration features which reveal
the complex couplings between dopants and point defects. It is therefore considered a meaningful test for advanced diffusion models.
</p>
<p>
As our simulations prove, the PLS model accurately reproduces the features of the
experimental profiles. In particular, the simulated profiles exhibit the enhanced tail, with
more or less pronounced inflexion in the surface region. This inflexion is the result of the
strong coupling between the defect gradients and the dopant.

<p>
To activate the new advanced diffusion model, specify
<b> PLS </b> in the
<b> METHOD </b> statement before the diffusion step to take into account Classical Dopant Diffusion models.
