This example demonstrates electrical analysis of a 0.2um MESFET structure
with Energy Balance (EB) and Drift-Diffusion (DD) Models. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Structure definition using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of energy balance models
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of Id/Vds with Vgs=0.0V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Repeat simulation using drift-diffusion models to compare results.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The example file consists of two Atlas runs. Both use the same device
structure defined in a similar manner to the previous example. The
first uses energy balance models to simulate Id/Vds and the second does
the same electrical simulation using the classical drift-diffusion
models. The aim of this example is to compare the effects of the
different models.
</p>
<p>
Energy balance models provide a more accurate description of physical
device effects, in particular the effect of velocity overshoot and
non-local impact ionization. These  are not handled by the classical
drift-diffusion model. These two
effects can be observed in sub-micron MESFET simulation.
This example concentrates on the velocity
overshoot effect in GaAs. Non-local impact ionization effects can be
seen in breakdown simulations. Since velocity overshoot is not
accounted for in drift-diffusion the results from simulations with this
model will underestimate the current severely. This discrepancy gets
worse as the channel length decreases.
</p>
<p>
The sequence of simulation syntax is similar to the previous example.
The structure differs from the previous only in the addition of heavily
doped source/drain regions.
</p>
<p>
The energy balance models are defined using
<b> model hcte.el</b> .
Since this is a unipolar device, only electron energy balance is
selected.  A key parameter in the energy balance model is the
relaxation time. Typical GaAs values are set on the
<b> material </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
A choice of numerical methods exists for energy balance simulation.
Here, full coupling of the 4 equations to be solved is selected by
<b> method newton.</b> The block method may also be added if convergence problems are seen
at the initial stage of the simulation.
</p>
<p>
The second run repeats the first but without &apos;models hcte.el&apos;. Results
from the two runs can be compared by overlaying the two log files in
TonyPlot. Two solution files are also saved and these can be compared
to see the difference in simulated electron concentration between the
two models. The statement
<b> output e.velocity </b> was used in both runs to save the electron velocity information to the
solution files. Selecting to plot this for the energy balance solution
file will show the overshoot effect.
