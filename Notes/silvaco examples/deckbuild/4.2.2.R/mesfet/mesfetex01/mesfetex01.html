This example demonstrates fabrication and electrical analysis of a
MESFET structure using the FLASH module of Athena and the Blaze
capability of Atlas.  The example uses DEVEDIT at various points
in the process to optimize the grid. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 MESFET fabrication using FLASH 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Re-meshing of structure in DEVEDIT
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting of device parameters for electrical simulation
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Electrical simulation of an Id/Vgs curve
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example starts by interfacing Athena and DEVEDIT to provide a
GaAs MESFET structure using silicon and beryllium implants. Details of
using FLASH can be found in the ATHENA_FLASH examples section.

It is necessary to set contact workfunctions for every Schottky contact
in each Atlas input file. The command
<b> contact name=gate work=4.87 </b> is used to set the gate workfunction. Source and drain contacts are
assumed to be ohmic. Users should note that this contact statement is
necessary even though the material Titanium was used in the Athena
simulation. Atlas does not recognize different metals, and the properties of
different metal regions are not transferred from Athena to Atlas.  Atlas
calculates the barrier height of a Schottky barrier in the following
mannor:
</p>
<b> barrier height = (metal work function - semiconductor electron</b> <b> affinity).  </b> <p>
Care should be taken to ensure the appropriate barrier height is chosen.
</p>
<p>
Low lifetimes typical of GaAs are set in the
<b> material </b> statement.  The
<b> models </b> statement is used to specify appropriate models within the simulation. The
<b> fldmob </b> parameter turns on the electric field dependent mobility.
<b> conmob</b> specifies the concentration dependent mobility. These values are taken
from a look-up table and exist only for room temperature.
</p>
<p>
The solution sequence for MESFET threshold voltage is first to obtain the initial solution at zero bias on all contacts. Then the drain is set to 0.1V. A log file is opened by the
<b> log </b> statement to store all terminal characteristics. The  final
<b> solve                    </b> statement ramps the gate from zero to -3V. Note that Atlas requires the
zero bias solution to be solved first in all cases. Thus the gate
voltage should be swept from zero to the value required. If a range of
both negative and positive gate voltages is required two sweeps can be
done by saving and loading the zero bias solution.
