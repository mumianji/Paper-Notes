This example demonstrates the calculation of s-parameters in a simple
MESFET. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>

<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting of GaAs mobility models and gate workfunction  
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vds characteristics with Vgs=0
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 AC analysis at a single DC bias at different frequencies
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Conversion of capacitance and conductance data from Atlas into s-parameters
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The geometry and doping of the  MESFET device used in this example is
described using the Atlas structural syntax.
Initially the mesh is specified in x and y, using the following command format
<b> x.mesh loc=aaa spac=bbb </b> specifying that there is a mesh spacing of bbb and x location aaa.
<b> region </b> statements are used to specify two GaAs regions which will later be
doped differently.
<b> electrode </b> statements specify the names and positions of electrodes. The
workfunction of the gate contact is set using
<b> contact</b> .
Each GaAs region is uniformly doped. An n-type active layer sits on top
of a lowly doped p-type substrate. GaAs mobility models for
concentration and field dependence are set in the
<b> models </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The numerical methods used at the initial stage of the simulation are
conservative. The statement
<b> method gummel newton </b> specifies that the decoupled (gummel) method is used at the start of
the simulation for each bias point. This switches to the coupled
(newton) method if convergence is not obtained. This is the most robust
method for the initial bias steps and for complex devices. It does
consume more CPU time and can lead to problems at high current levels.
If these problems occur the statement
<b> method newton </b> can be used.
</p>
<p>
The DC simulation proceeds by ramping the drain voltage in the
<b> solve </b> statement until Vds=3.0V. After this, a log file is opened and AC analysis begins.
The full sweep of frequency is done on the line:
<br/>
<b> solve ac.analysis direct frequency=1.e9 fstep=2.e9 nfsteps=20 </b> <br/>
The &apos;ac&apos; parameter switches on the AC analysis. &apos;direct&apos; specifies a
robust AC solver for high frequencies. Activating the &apos;direct&apos; solver
will cause more memory to be allocated than was used during the DC
simulation. If your system does not have enough virtual memory to run
the AC application, the simulation will stop here with an error
message.  The exact amount of memory required depends on the number of
mesh points. The &apos;frequency&apos; value is the initial frequency of the AC
signal, fstep is the step value added to this frequency, and nfsteps is the number
of steps.
</p>
<p>
The AC analysis in Atlas calculates the real and imaginary
current components from a small AC signal on top of the existing DC
solution. From these currents Atlas calculates the conductance and
capacitance between each pair of electrodes. By plotting the log file,
users can see graphs of drain-gate conductance (C drain&gt;gate) or
total gate capacitance (-1*C gate&gt;gate).
</p>
<p>
The s-parameters (or Z, Y and ABCD parameters) are calculated by setting
the
<b> s.param </b> (or y.param etc) on the log statement preceeding the ac analysis.
The most important parameters are the *port parameters. s-parameter
analysis assumes the device is a two port device with 4 terminals.
The inport and outport are used to assign the respective electrodes.
Users should ensure the correct definition of all ports.
In this example the input port is set to the gate and output
port to the drain.
