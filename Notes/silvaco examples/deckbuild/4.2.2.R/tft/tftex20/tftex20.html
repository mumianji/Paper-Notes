The hysteresis effect is caused by different reaction time scale between forward and reverse sweep.
This is related to differnt reaction time scale between trapping and de-trapping process.
In IGZO TFT case, the hysteresis simulation can be shown by several method.
One of easiest way is to use Heiman interface trapping model. Or we can use chemical ion reaction model which was
introduced in previous tft example to explain the oxygen vacancy ionization and recovery process.
In this example, we used direct transient simulation with adjusting capture cross section.
In steady state(DC) simulation, it always show small current than transient mode simulation current. It means that
in DC case, there is enough time to trap carrier but in transient mode it depends on how ramping speed is performed to
measure IV curve given capture cross section.
In this simulation, we choosed somewhat small capture cross section(SIGTAE) to enlarge the effect of hysteresis.

tftex20.aux is skeleton input file which include all necessary input information.
tftex20.in is launch file to split various ramping time to get the different hysteresis effect.
