This example demonstrates how integrated process and device TFT simulations
can be performed in Athena and Atlas. The input files consists of :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of TFT device in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Forward (positive) Vgs sweep in Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Reverse (negative) Vgs sweep in Atlas
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first part of the file uses Athena to construct the geometry and
doping of a TFT device. The starting substrate is defined as silicon
dioxide to emulate the flat panel display glass. The transistor is
simulated with a metal gate on the bottom and a gate insulator made
from Oxide and Nitride. A lightly doped Silicon layer is deposited to
act as the channel region. A heavily doped layer is placed on top to
become the source/drain regions. Single crystal Silicon or Polysilicon
could be used equally well at this stage. However the important
electrical properties of the material are set in Atlas, so at this stage
it is not important which material is used.  Metal for the source/drain
contacts is then applied. An etchback through the metal and
heavily doped silicon is then carried out. Some of the lightly doped silicon layer
is also removed. This final etch separates the source and drain. The
final stage in Athena is to define the electrodes for use in Atlas.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas part of this file is used to simulate the gate voltage bias
from -20V to +20V with the drain at +10V. Before the biasing is applied
it is first necessary to set all the relevant material parameters.
</p>
<p>
In simulating TFTs, the most important requirement is setting of the
<b> defect </b> statement specifying the density of states in the semiconductor
bandgap. The defect states are specified as donor-like and
acceptor-like and as tail and mid-gap gaussian states. This  gives a
total of four distributions each with their own trapping cross sections
for electrons and holes for a total of eight cross section values. The
values included in this example are typical of amorphous silicon used
in TFT transistors, but each user has a different process. The defect
densities are sensitive to the hydrogen annealing of the device and so
must be tuned by the user.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> material </b> statement is used to set the material constants of the
semiconductor to those of amorphous silicon. The interface step defines
an interface charge on each semiconductor/insulator interface. It is
possible to vary this charge by position using the bounding box
parameters on the interface statement.
</p>
<p>
The models needed for TFT simulation are simple. A constant mobility as
defined by the material statement is used and SRH recombination is
included. In order to simulate reverse leakage the band-band tunneling
model is included by:
<b> models bbt.std</b> . The exponential parameter of the band-band tunneling model is
adjusted for amorphous silicon.
</p>
<p>
The first step in the solve sequence is to ramp the drain voltage up to
+10V. At this point a file is stored. The reverse gate voltage
ramp is then applied. The gate voltage is ramped up to -20V. The drain
current will increase during this ramp due to tunneling current in the
TFT. The magnitude of this is controlled by the parameters of the
band-band tunneling model. at the end of the ramp the final drain
current is extracted.
</p>
<p>
At the highest reverse gate bias a structure file is saved. By plotting
the recombination in the device at this bias it is possible to see the
band-band generation current as a negative recombination term.
</p>
<p>
The final step is the forward gate voltage sweep. This is performed by first
loading the solution saved with zero gate voltage. Then the gate is
ramped to +20V. From this data the
<b> extract </b> syntax is used to get the
sub-threshold leakage slope. This slope, which is typically 0.5-1.5
V/decade is sensitive to the defect distribution in the semiconductor.
