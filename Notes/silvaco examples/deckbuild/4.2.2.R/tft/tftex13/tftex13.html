This example performs Id/Vgs, Id/Vd, and CV simulations of TFT device with material
properties corresponding to amorphous IGZO (indium galium zinc oxide) material and show comparison with
published experiment data. Measured a-IGZO material DOS(density-of-state) by CV analysis is inserted
into simulation input and show almost the same transfer curve and output curve behaviour.

The key command in a-IGZO:TFT simulation is the
<b> Source/Drain Schottky barrier and height</b> This is done by proper workfunction of source/drain metal and activated by model UST(Universal Schottky Tunnling Model). gate metal and both S/D metal are the same workfunction=5.0 [eV]
<br/>
<b> DOS-defect/intdefect statement. </b> It is used to define a continuous density of trap states in
the a-IGZO active channel and the relevant trapping cross-sections.Also bottom interface fixed charge.
For this purpose, we used C-interpreter function to define DOS in IGZO active channel region.
<br/>
<b> IDVG/IDVD DC Analysis</b> The Id/Vgs and Id/Vd ramping is done in a similar manner to the threshold voltage
tests for MOS devices described in the MOS examples.
<b> CV-analysis</b> The Cgs and Cgd are simulated and compared to published data for each frequency.
<br/>
The measured data were taken from published paper with digitizer.
