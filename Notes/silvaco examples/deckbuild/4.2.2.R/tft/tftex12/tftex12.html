This example shows the effect of measurement time on the results obtained for
typical TFT DC I-V measurements.  For some TFT devices, where the insulator
contains traps that are within communication distance of the semiconductor
channel, the time and bias dependent trapping and de-trapping events create a
<b> hysterisis effect </b> in the IV curves.  The time dependency of the insulator trapping and
de-trapping events, creates a hysterisis effect, the magnitude of which depends
on the time taken to take the measurements.
</p>
<p>
In order to greatly simplify the time dependency simulation of insulator trap
induced effects, the device simulator has incorporated the
<b> Heiman model </b> which is invoked by specifying the &quot;heiman&quot; parameter in the
<b> inttrap </b> statement.
The Heiman model allows the simulation of insulator trap time dependency
effects using simple DC solve statements.  The maximum effective communication
distance of the insulator traps with the semiconductor channel, is specified
using the
<b> depth </b> parameter in the &quot;inttrap&quot; statement.  The depth resolution of the insulator
traps is specified by the
<b> hpoints </b> parameter in the inttrap statement.  Other than these Heiman related
parameters, the rest of the inttrap statement is exactly the same as a normal
inttrap statement.
</p>
<p>
All that remains to take account of the measurement time dependency effects,
caused by the insulator traps, is to specify the total measurement time on
the solve statement.   This is done using the
<b> timespan </b> parameter on the solve statement.  In this particular example, the &quot;timespan&quot;
parameter is set as a variable called
<b> measurementtime </b> at the begining of the Atlas section of the input file, so that the input file
can be easily modified to create a design of experiments using the measurement
time as a variable.
