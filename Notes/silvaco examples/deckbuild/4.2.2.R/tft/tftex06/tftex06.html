This example demonstrates Ids/Vgs and Id/Vds  3D analysis of a 10um
channel length, ultra-thin TFT transistor. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Formation of 3D structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vgs solution with Vds=0.1V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vds solution with Vgs=1.5V
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The formation of this 3D structure is performed using the Atlas syntax.
The syntax used is very similar to that used to create a normal 2D example. The
definition of dimensions in the third direction is defined by the
<b> z </b> indicator. Thus z.min and z.max define extents in the z direction, just
as x.min and x.max do in the x direction.
</p>
<p>
The TFT device is composed of a 0.05 micron layer of polysilicon on a 0.45
micron silicon dioxide substrate.  The device has a 12 nm thick gate
oxide and a gate length of 10 microns.  The gate width is 80um.
</p>
<p>
After the device description the
<b> model </b> statement is used to select a set of physical models for this simulation.  In this case,
these models are &apos;srh&apos; recombination, bandgap narrowing, and the conmob and fldmob mobility models.
The
<b> impact </b> statement is used to specify the Selberherr model for impact ioisation in the 3D simulation. This is necessary to model &quot;kink&quot; effects that are often observed in TFT Id-Vd characteristics.
The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to assign the work function on the gate material. It this case an aluminum gate is used which assigns a workfunction of 4.10 V to the gate contact.
</p>
<p>
The numerical methods used are also similar to the previous example:
<b> METHOD gummel newton carr=2</b> . This means that if convergence is not reached in decoupled mode (gummel) the simulator
will automatically switch to coupled mode (newton). In addition, a two carrier solution
is performed by solving Poisson&apos;s equation for potential and the electron and hole
continuity equations.
</p>
<p>
The drain voltage is set to 0.1V, and then the gate voltage is swept to 1.5V to measure the Ids/Vgs curve.
</p>
<p>
Then the gate voltage is set to 1.5V, and then the drain voltage is
swept to 3V.  At this point faster solutions are obtained using the
coupled newton algorithm so the simulation switches to this
method.  The drain voltage is then ramped to 4V.
