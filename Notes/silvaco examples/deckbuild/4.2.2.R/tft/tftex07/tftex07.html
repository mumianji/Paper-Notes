<p>
It is possible to specify an energy dependent distribution of traps in
two ways using SPISCES/TFT. The original method assumed a discrete set
of traps across the bandgap but now it is possible to use a
mathematically continuous energy distribution of states.
</p>
<p>
The syntax used in this example is identical to that in tftex03.in
except that now two simulations are performed each with the density of
states assumed to contain 24 energy levels across the bandgap. This is
speciied using the
<b> DEFECT</b> parameters
<b> numa</b> and
<b> numd</b> . The first simulation is otherwise identical to that described in tftex03.in. The second simulation uses the keyword
<b> continuous</b> on the
<b> DEFECTS</b> statement to define that the distribution is continuous. The simulation then compares the Id-Vg characteristics for the two simulations.
