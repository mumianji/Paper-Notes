This example demonstrates Id-Vds and Id-Vgs calculations in a single quantum-well
AlGaAs/GaAs HEMT. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the heterojunction structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Material and models parameter specification 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of Id/Vds and Id/Vgs characteristics 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Display of the results in TonyPlot
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The device under consideration is the same as in the previous example
in this section. The device geometry, mesh, regions, electrodes and
doping distribution
are described with the same sequence of statements as in the example above.
The same material parameters and physical models are applied except for the
impact ionization-generation model. Since the breakdown analysis is not the
goal of this example and the range of voltages applied are far away from
the breakdown region where the impact ionization effects become essential, the
<b> impact </b> statement is excluded and no impact ionization-generation considered.
The contact and interface statements are a repeat of those from the previous example.
</p>
<p>
After the initial solution is obtained, the gate voltage is set to 0,
the structure under zero bias is displayed using TonyPlot, and the
Id-Vds characteristic is calculated. As in the previous example the
drain voltage is first ramped up to 0.3V. The solutions are obtained
using the combined Gummel-Newton algorithm specified in the
<b> method gummel newton </b> statement. The algorithm implies that if the solution does not converge
in the course of Gummel iterations, the program will automatically
switch over to the Newton algorithm.
</p>
<p>
Next the drain voltage is ramped up to 3V. This part of simulation is performed
using the Newton method:
<b> method newton </b> The results of simulation are saved in the log file and displayed using TonyPlot.
</p>
<p>
Simulation of the Id-Vgs characteristic is performed next. At the first stage the
solution for Vgs=-0.9V and Vds=0.5V is obtained. Next, the gate voltage
is ramped up to 0.6V with the step of 0.1V.
</p>
<p>
The results of simulation are again saved in a separate log file and displayed using TonyPlot.
