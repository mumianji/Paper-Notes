This example demonstrates simulation of avalanche breakdown in a single
quantum-well lattice matched AlGaAs/GaAs HEMT. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the heterojunction structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Material and models parameter specification 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of Id-Vds and breakdown characteristic 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Display of the results in TonyPlot
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The device under consideration consists of the highly doped (1.e18/cm3)
AlGaAs layer with the Al composition fraction of 0.3, the GaAs channel
layer 250 A thick with the donor concentration of 1.e15 /cm3, and
AlGaAs buffer layer with the same doping. The parts of the channel
under the source and drain are heavily doped, and source and drain
electrodes are located vertically, touching the channel region. This technique
accounts for the alloying of contact material and the tunneling of carriers
through the heterojunction. The channel length is 0.5 micron.
</p>
<p>
In the first part of the input file, the device is described using
the Atlas structural syntax. The description includes the mesh, regions
locations, electrodes locations, and doping distribution.
The
<b> region </b> statements are used to define the AlGaAs and GaAs regions. The Al
composition fraction (x.composition=0.3) is defined here as well. Note
that an artificial oxide layer (region num=4) is defined here providing
the possibility to specify AlGaAs surface states using the
<b> interface </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
After the device description, the first
<b> material </b> statement is used to specify the electron and hole SRH lifetimes
applied to both GaAs and AlGaAs materials. In the second
<b> material </b> statement the low field mobilities, electron affinity, and density of
states in the conduction band Nc are defined for AlGaAs. In this
example the band alignment is calculated  by using energy band gaps and
electron affinities of the materials forming heterojunctions. If not
explicitly specified in the
<b> material</b> statements the default values of other material parameters are applied.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> models </b> statements are used to specify the following set of models : field
dependent mobility, and SRH. The two carrier transport model is
specified here as well (the default). In addition, the concentration dependent
mobility model is activated.
</p>
<p>
In order to simulate avalanche breakdown the impact ionization-generation model
should be turned on. This is done using the
<b> impact selb </b> statement in which the Selberherr impact ionization model is activated.
All basic impact ionization parameters are user-accessible and can be
modified by the user. As an example the appropriate set of parameters
is defined in this statement. The parameters apply to both GaAs and
AlGaAs materials.
</p>
<p>
The gate electrode in HEMT structures is of Schottky type. To indicate this
the
<b> contact </b> statement is used to define the workfunction of the gate electrode,
which gives the Schottky barrier height of approximately 0.9V.
</p>
<p>
The initial solution is performed automatically if not specified.
The gate voltage is set to zero, the structure under zero bias is
displayed using TonyPlot, and the drain voltage is ramped up to 0.3V.
The solutions are obtained using the combined Gummel-Newton algorithm
specified in the statement
<b>        method gummel newton.  </b> The algorithm implies that if the solution does not converge in the
course of the decoupled Gummel iterations, the program will
automatically switch over to the fully coupled Newton algorithm.
</p>
<p>
Next the drain voltage is ramped until the drain current reaches the
predefined value of 9.e-5 A/um well within the breakdown region,
using the
<b> compliance  </b> limits on the
{solve}
solve statement. These
calculations are performed using the Newton method :
<br/>
<b>        method newton.  </b> <br/>
The results of the simulation are saved in the log file and the Id-Vds
breakdown characteristics are displayed using TonyPlot.
