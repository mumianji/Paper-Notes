In this example a pseudomorphic HEMT structure based on the
GaAs-AlGaAs-InGaAs-InP material system is constructed using DEVEDIT.
The structure is then passed to Atlas for electrical testing. The input
file consists of the following main portions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the device in DEVEDIT
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Electrical simulation of a family of Id/Vds curves
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of Id/Vgs characteristics
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Basic parameter extraction
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first part of the input file constructs the HEMT geometry, material regions,
doping profiles, and electrodes in DEVEDIT. The structure considered is non-
planar with a non-rectangular recessed gate. This demonstrates the important
capability of DEVEDIT to generate arbitrarily shaped geometries. The device is
created in DEVEDIT by drawing the device regions in interactive mode and
specifying 2D doping distributions. The device is based on a GaAs substrate.
It employs a double channel HEMT concept where the InGaAs
channel is sandwiched between two AlGaAs regions. The structure also employs
2 delta- (or pulse-) dopings above and below the channel in both AlGaAs regions.
These are modeled by narrow, 10 angstrom thick layers. The delta-doping
usually expressed in terms of planar concentration (cm-2)  must be
recalculated into bulk doping (cm-3) given the thickness of the layers.
</p>
<p>
The delta-doped regions play an important role and are typical for
modern HEMT technologies. They are used as additional carrier
suppliers to the channel and for better control of the threshold
voltage and other device parameters. The source and drain cap regions
are made of GaAs. In practical applications the source and drain
contact alloys often penetrate deep into the structure well below the
channel. This is modeled by heavily doped areas under the source and
drain in which the vertical doping distribution is assumed to be
Gaussian, and the horizontal one is approximated by the complimentary
error function. The means and the set of functions for specifying
arbitrary 2D doping distributions are provided by the DEVEDIT. The
composition fractions of AlGaAs (0.22 for Al) and InGaAs (0.78 for Ga)
are specified in DEVEDIT as respective region attributes. The
mesh was generated automatically by specifying basic mesh constraints
and refining it along the x- and/or y-directions in the
important areas of the device.
</p>
<p>
DEVEDIT then generates two types of files: a DEVEDIT input file and the
structure file. The first can be run in DeckBuild to produce the
corresponding structure file and is included here as the first part of
the input file. The second can be read in directly by Atlas in the MESH
statement. Note that the DEVEDIT input file can be edited as any other
input file. It is straightforward to change the type and value of the
doping associated with each region or resize regions.  More importantly,
DEVEDIT input files can also be read directly into the graphical user
interface of DEVEDIT to provide all the menu options used to construct
the structure.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas simulation begins from reading in the structure from
DEVEDIT.  DeckBuild provides autointerface between DEVEDIT and Atlas so
that the structure produced by DEVEDIT is transferred to Atlas without
having to indicate the MESH statement (commented out in this example).
Without the automatic DEVEDIT/Atlas interface under DeckBuild, the MESH
statement is needed to load the structure and the mesh.
</p>
<p>
The first active statements in the Atlas portion of the input file are
the contact, material and model  definitions. The gate workfunction is set up
in the
<b> contact </b> statement. The material parameters and physical models are
specified in the
<b> material </b> and
<b> models </b> statements respectively on material-by-
material basis. Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and electric field
dependent mobility models are applied to all the material/regions. For
GaAs and AlGaAs regions doping dependent mobilities and recombination
parameters (lifetimes) are also applied. Conversely for InGaAs regions
low field mobilities and carrier lifetimes are explicitly specified in
the material statement. The band alignment
is defined here using the
<b> align </b> parameter, which defines the portion of the energy
band gap difference applied to the conduction band. This parameter is given in the
<b> material </b> statements.
</p>
<p>
The simulation is first performed to obtain the condition of the structure
for 3 different gate biases, Vgs=0, -0.2, and -0.4 V, with the source and drain
grounded. The respective states of the structure are saved in three
separate solution files. Then the family of three Id-Vds
characteristics is calculated in three separate drain voltage sweeps
from 0 up to 2 V. Each series of the drain biasing is performed after loading
the solutions with the respective gate bias.  The Id-Vds characteristics
are saved in three separate log files. The final conditions of the
structure with 2 V on the drain are also saved in separate solution files.
The zero bias condition is loaded again and the Id-Vgs characteristic is calculated.
</p>
<p>
At the end of simulation, parameter extraction statements are used to extract the
following parameters using the
<b> extract </b> feature of DeckBuild:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Threshold voltage
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Maximum saturation current (Idss)
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Gate voltage at Id=0.3*Idss 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The results are also displayed using TonyPlot:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Id/Vds characteristics
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vgs characteristic 
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
