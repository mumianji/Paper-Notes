This example demonstrates Id-Vds calculations in single quantum-well
AlGaAs/GaAs HEMT using Energy Balance (EB) and Drift Diffusion (DD)
Models. It includes
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of a heterojunction structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Material parameter specification 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Physical model specification including the energy balance model
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of Id-Vds characteristic with Vgs=0.0V 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>

<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Display of combined results in TonyPlot
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The example file consists of two Atlas runs. Both use the same device
structure defined in a similar manner to the previous two examples. The
first run uses energy balance models to simulate Id-Vds characteristics
and the second does the same electrical simulation using the classical
drift-diffusion model. The aim of the example is to compare the effects
of the different carrier transport models.
</p>
<p>
Energy balance models provide a more accurate description of physical
device effects, in particular the effects of velocity overshoot and
non-local impact ionization. These are not handled by the classical
drift-diffusion model. These two effects can be observed in sub-micron
HEMT simulation.  This example concentrates on the velocity overshoot
effect in the GaAs-AlGaAs structure. Non-local impact ionization
effects can be seen in breakdown simulations. Since velocity overshoot
is not accounted for in the drift-diffusion model, the results from
simulations with this model will underestimate the current. This
discrepancy gets worse as the channel length decreases.
</p>
<p>
The sequence of simulation syntax is similar to the previous example. For energy
balance simulation, additional input parameters need to be defined in particular
carrier energy and mobility relaxation times. In these examples the
electron relaxation times taurel.el and taumob.el are defined in the
two separate
<b> material</b> statements for the GaAs and AlGaAs materials, overriding the default values.
In the same statements the low field electron mobilities are specified for GaAs
and AlGaAs. The saturation velocity is also explicitly defined here for GaAs.
The
<b> material </b> statement for AlGaAs also contains the
<b> align </b> parameter, which defines the portion of the energy band gap difference going
to the conduction band (60% in this example) at the GaAs-AlGaAs
heterojunction. If the
<b> align </b> parameter is present in the
<b> material </b> statement the energy band alignment is calculated
based on the value of this parameter rather than using electron
affinities of the materials forming the respective heterojunction.
</p>
<p>
Since HEMTs are majority carrier devices and the impact-ionization and breakdown
are not a subject of analysis here, the one carrier (electrons only)
transport model is used in both continuity and energy balance
equations. Thus the following three basic equations are solved in this
example to simulate the device characteristics: Poisson, electron
continuity and energy balance equations.
</p>
<p>
In the
<b> model </b> statements the set of physical models used is specified: field
dependent mobility, and the one carrier transport model (carriers=1 electron).
The solution of the energy balance equation for electrons is activated in
this statement using the parameter hcte.el.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to specify the workfunction of the gate electrode, giving the
Schottky barrier height of approximately 0.8V.
</p>
<p>
After the initial solution the gate voltage is set to 0, and the Id-Vds
characteristic is calculated. First the drain voltage is ramped up to
0.1V. The solutions are obtained using the combined Gummel-Newton block
algorithm specified in the following statement:
</p>
<b>        method gummel block newton </b> <p>
The algorithm implies that, if the solution does not converge in the course of
Gummel iterations, the program will automatically switch over to the
block algorithm where the Poisson and electron continuity equations are
solved by the  Newton algorithm with the frozen electron temperature,
and then the electron continuity equation and energy balance equation
are solved by the Newton algorithm. If the solution still does not
converge, the program will switch over to the fully coupled Newton
method.
</p>
<p>
Next the drain voltage is ramped up to 3V. This part of simulation is performed
using the Newton method:
</p>
<b>        method newton </b> <p>
The results of the simulation are saved in a log file to be displayed later
with the results of the DD simulation.
</p>
<p>
The second Atlas run repeats the first but uses the conventional one
carrier Drift Diffusion Model: Poisson&apos;s equation and the electron
continuity equation are solved self-consistently. The same set of
physical models is used, except the energy balance
equation. The latter is turned off by not indicating the hcte.el
parameter in the
<b> models </b> statement. The resulting Id-Vds characteristic is saved in a log file.
The statement
<b> output con.band val.band e.velocity </b> is used in both runs to save the conduction and valence band
potentials and the electron velocity information to the solution files.
Generating the solution files in the energy balance simulation and
selecting to plot them will show the velocity overshoot effect.
</p>
<p>
Results from two runs with the EB and DD models are compared by overlaying the two log files in TonyPlot.
