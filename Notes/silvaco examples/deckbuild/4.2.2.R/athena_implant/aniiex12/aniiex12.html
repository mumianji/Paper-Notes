This example employs a Monte Carlo implant model to implant boron into
the sidewall of a trench. The
<b> RELAX </b> statement is also used to
adapt the mesh after trench etching so that a fine mesh can be created
at the surface where it is needed to resolve the implantation.
</p>
<p>
For this example, ions are incident at an angle of 15 degrees from the
direction of the y-axis.  Thus, the ions are incident directly only on
the right side of the trench and at the top exposed surface.  The
doping on the left side and bottom of the trench is due to reflected
ions.  There is a visible reduction in the depth of the profile about 1
micron from the bottom of the trench.  This corresponds to the point in
the trench where ions are directly incident above this point and
shadowed below it. The first TonyPlot shows the ion trajectories
(including those of reflected ions). To facilitated the visualization
select the LINE (the last icon in the
<b> DISPLAY </b> menu) button.
</p>
<p>
Following the implant calculation, a short diffusion is performed and
the results are plotted using
<b> TonyPlot</b> .
The output shows 1D profiles
from the surface of the unetched silicon and also from the implanted
sidewall of the trench.
