This example shows how C-Interpreter can be used for control of
PLUS.ONE (or UNIT.DAMAGE)  and &lt;311&gt; Cluster formation models. Both
models estimate distributions of point defect and &lt;311&gt; clusters by
scaling implant profile using factors DAM.F and CLUSTER.F,
correspondingly. Also, in the case of &lt;311&gt;, the user specifies the
concentration limits within which the clusters can be formed.
</p>
<p>
These methods of damage model control are very limited and sometimes
could not represent physical reality. For example, it is observed that
clusters are not formed near silicon surface, but it cannot be
specified within model limitations.
</p>
<p>
The first part of this example, and corresponding Figure on the left, shows that two &lt;311&gt; cluster bands are
formed. This situation is even more pronounced in 2D since the &lt;311&gt;
cluster band could propagate laterally and end up at the surface. This
means that if the model is applied to S/D or LDD implant of a
MOS device, the &lt;311&gt; would &quot;appear&quot; under the gate which is incorrect.
</p>
<p>
Use of C-interpreter allows us to modify the models. In this case the C-interpreter
file
<b> aniiex16.lib </b> allows the cluster to be formed only at depths &gt; 0.15 microns. Also, C-interpreter
allows us to modify the PLUS.ONE model. In this example,  C-interpreter specifies that the PLUS.ONE model is
to be applied to concentrations only above level of 3e15 /cm^3.
</p>
<p>
The C-interpreter file is specified by the
<b> DAM.MOD </b> parameter in the
<b> IMPLANT </b> statement.
