This example shows the difference between two implants as
a result of the order in which they are done.  The implant
damage from the first implant affects the second implant.
</p>
<p>
An impenetrable
<b> barrier </b> layer is deposited upon silicon in this example,
which is then etched to create a 10 nm wide window.  This structure
forms the starting point for two separate cases.
</p>
<p>
In the first case, a 10 keV arsenic implant is performed, followed by
a 10 keV boron implant.  Arsenic, a heavier ion than boron, creates
significant damage in the silicon.  As a result, the crystal
integrity of silicon is reduced, which in turn reduces the boron
channeling.
</p>
<p>
The second case reverses the order of the implants (but maintains
the same energy and dose).  Boron is
first implanted, and the normal
<b> [100] </b> channel profile of boron as determined by BCA is formed.  The arsenic
implant follows. Since boron is much lighter than arsenic, there is
less damage created by the boron implant (which can also be viewed in the
<b> .history.str </b> files), and arsenic forms nearly the same distribution
as in the first case.  Quantitatively, the peak concentration
(the projected range) of boron is noticeably deeper in the
second case.
</p>
<p>
The current example simulates 10,000 ions incident upon the
structure for each implant.  Increased accuracy, at the
cost of increased simulation time, can be obtained by increasing the
<b> n.ion </b> parameter of the
<b> IMPLANT </b> statement to 100,000.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> impct.point </b> parameter specifies a precise impact location
for the ions.  This parameter makes the barrier layer redundant,
and is available only for Monte Carlo ion implant simulations.
