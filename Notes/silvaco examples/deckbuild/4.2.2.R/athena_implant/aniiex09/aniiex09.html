This example compares analytical methods for simulation of 2D implantation.
It also shows how to use Monte Carlo simulation for estimation of spatial
moments.
</p>
<p>
In the first part, Monte Carlo simulation is used to save a structure
with spatial moments. Only 20000 trajectories is enough to estimate the moments.
</p>
<p>
In the second part, all 8 spatial moments are extracted. Then, the default
and
<b>FULL.LAT </b> model are used to simulate 2D implant into the 0.2 microns mask window. The default method uses only 5 spatial moments, and lateral distribution is
Gaussian  with standard deviation independent from the vertical coordinate.
FULL.LAT model uses 8 spatial moments and lateral distribution is a symmetrical
Pearson function with standard deviation varying as a parabolic function
of the vertical coordinate.
In general, lateral kurtosis should also depend on the vertical
coordinate, however the simplified approach with constant kurtosis slightly
smaller than the averaged fourth lateral moment KURTT is used. Obtained 2D
profiles are overlaid in TonyPlot.
