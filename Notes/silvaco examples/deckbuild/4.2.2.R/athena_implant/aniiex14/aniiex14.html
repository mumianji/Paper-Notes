This example demonstrates that 0-tilt implantation can be simulated using the
Binary Collision Approximation (BCA) Model. In the BCA model the deflection
of the moving particles is calculated in a strict binary way - between the
moving ion and the closest atom in the lattice. The difference between
the BCA model and earlier implemented Monte Carlo crystalline model is
much more accurate determination of the closest atom and more accurate
calculation of impact dependent inelastic energy losses. Therefore,
BCA is capable of much more accurately predicting trajectories of
well-channeled particles and therefore usually gives much better
agreement with experiments in those cases where the channeling process
is dominant, e.g. for 0 degrees implants.

The simulated profile is compared with experiment (R.J. Shreutelkamp, et.al.,
Nucl. Instr. &amp; Methods, v. B55, p. 615, 1991) and SVDP simulation which is
also based on SIMS experiments. It should be stressed here that
experimental results for well channeled implants are quite sensitive
to many factors including surface conditions (thickness and uniformity
of oxide surface layer) and precision of the ion beam orientation
and beam width. Even 0.5 degree deviation in these parameters could
result in considerable changes of measured implanted profiles.
Therefore, agreement between these simulations and experiment should
be considered as quite reasonable.
