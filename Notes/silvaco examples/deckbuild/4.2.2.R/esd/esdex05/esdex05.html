In this example, the steady state second breakdown simulation of an NMOS
transistor is performed.  Second breakdown analysis is an important
figure of merit in the understanding of the resistance of devices to
high current (voltage) stress caused by the ESD events. This example shows:

 Formation of a MOS structure in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface to Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of lattice heat flow models 
<br/>

  <li>
 Analysis of a non-isothermal IV curve 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The MOS structure is constructed using Athena process simulation. This
structure is passed to Atlas for HBM test simulation.  The NMOS
transistor is a 0.8um LDD device using oxide spacers. For a more
complete description of the MOS process simulation, see the MOS examples.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas syntax shows a simple and effective procedure for the
tracing of the complicated S-shape I-V characteristics
that could be used with any initial NMOS structure.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas simulation begins with the definition of the models and material
parameters of the device. The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to define the
workfunction of the polysilicon electrode. The
<b> material </b> statement is
used to define the electron and hole lifetimes in
semiconductor.
</p>
<p>
The physical models used in this simulation reflect the different
physical effects important to electrothermal device simulation.  The
mobility model CVT includes the concentration, electric field and
temperature dependencies, as well as a surface mobility degradation
effects.  In addition to the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination model
(SRH), the recombination model AUGER is included to take into account
the high injection level effects. Band gap narrowing is taken into
account by means of the BGN parameter.  The continuity equations for
both carriers are selected by default or by using parameter carriers=2
in the METHOD statement.  Impact ionization is necessary for any
breakdown simulation and it is also included here.
</p>
<p>
A nonisothermal approach is used, which means that the heat flow equation
is solved in addition to the semiconductor equations and all physical
parameters become temperature dependent.  The syntax
<b> models lat.temp </b> enables the solution of the heat flow equation.
</p>
<p>
In all nonisothermal simulations, the definition of the thermal
boundary conditions is very important.  Thermal boundary conditions are
defined in the
<b> thermcontact </b> statement.  A value of the thermal
conductance determined from the heat conductivity of the substrate is
specified at the thermocontact located along the substrate. Thermal
isolation is assumed where no thermal contacts are specified. Here, thermal
isolation conditions are assumed on the all other surfaces besides the
bottom.
</p>
<p>
To simulate the device second breakdown the curve tracing algorithm was
used. For more details of this algorithm and its syntax see the
snapback example in the Advanced MOS section.
</p>
<p>
The steady state current/voltage characteristics are saved in a LOG
file.  Using TonyPlot it is possible to observe the maximum
temperature in the device versus current/voltage.
The sharp decrease of the voltage on the nonisothermal I-V curve
shows the onset of second breakdown.
