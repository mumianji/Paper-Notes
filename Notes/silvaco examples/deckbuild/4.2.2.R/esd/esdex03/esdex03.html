In this example, transient simulation of Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)
on an NMOS transistor using the Human Body Model (HBM) is performed.
During the ESD event significant local heating is produced. The
solution of local lattice temperature is included. This example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Formation of a MOS structure in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface to Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of lattice heat flow models 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Use of current boundary conditions and non-linear transient pulse to simulate a HBM ESD event.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Analysis of both the temperature distribution in the device and non-isothermal IV curve.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The MOS structure is constructed using Athena process simulation. This
structure is passed to Atlas for a HBM test simulation.  The NMOS
transistor is a 0.8um LDD device using oxide spacers. For a more
complete description of the MOS process simulation see the MOS examples.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas syntax shows a simple and effective test procedure for
HBM ESD simulation that may be used with any initial NMOS structure.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas simulation begins with definition of the models and material
parameters of the device. The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to define the
workfunction of the polysilicon electrode. The
<b> material  </b> statement is
used to define the capture times (electron and hole lifetimes) in
the semiconductor.
</p>
<p>
The physical models used in this simulation reflect the different
physical effects important to ESD device simulation.  The mobility
model &apos;analytic&apos; accounts for concentration and the temperature
dependencies.
</p>
<p>
The mobility model &apos;fldmob&apos; accounts for the electric field dependency. In addition to
the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination model (SRH), the recombination
model &apos;auger&apos; is included to take into account the high injection level
effects. Band gap narrowing is taken into account by means of the bgn
parameter.  The continuity equations for both carriers are selected
by default. The impact
ionization model is enabled using the
<b> impact selb </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
A nonisothermal approach is used, which means that the heat flow equation
is solved in addition to the semiconductor equations and all physical
parameters become temperature dependent.  The syntax
<b> models lat.temp </b> enables the solution of the heat flow equation.
</p>
<p>
The definition of the thermal boundary conditions is very important
in all non-isothermal simulations.  Thermal boundary conditions are
defined in the
<b> thermcontact </b> statement.  A value of the thermal
conductance determined from the heat conductivity of the substrate is
specified at the thermocontact located along the substrate. Thermal
isolation is assumed where no thermal contacts are specified. Here thermal
isolation conditions are assumed on all other surfaces besides the
bottom.
</p>
<p>
To simulate the device interaction with the simplified HBM test circuit
the current pulse is applied to the drain of the MOS structure in the
reverse direction.  The current pulse risetime is 10ns and the
exponential decay time is 150ns, which corresponds to the discharge of
the 100pF capacitor through the 1500 Ohm resistor into the test device.
These values are the definition of the Human Body Model.
</p>
<p>
The transient current/voltage characteristics are saved in the LOG
file.  Using TonyPlot it is possible to observe the maximum
temperature in the device versus time. The temperature increases with
time and peaks significantly after the peak current. The value of the
maximum temperature can be extracted and used as a figure of merit for
comparing the ESD protection capability of various device designs.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> probe </b> statement is used to define quantities to be measured at each bias step.
The values from these quantities are saved in the log file and can be
plotted versus time and bias. The first probe statement saves the
<i> lattice temperature at the drain contact</i> and the second
<i> electric field across the gate oxide.</i> The former can be used to determine the likelihood of metal melting and the
latter to determine likelihood of gate dielectric breakdown.
</p>
<p>
The solution at a time of 10ns and at the final stage are saved. All
internal distributions can be observed using TonyPlot. Most
interesting is that the temperature distribution in the MOSFET shows the
location and value of the hot spot.
