Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) is an experimental tool for studying
electrically active defects (known as charge carrier traps) in semiconductors.
DLTS establishes fundamental defect parameters and measures their concentration
in the material.
</p>
<p>
DLTS investigates defects present in a space charge (depletion) region of a
simple electronic device. The most commonly used are Schottky diodes or p-n junctions.
In the measurement process the steady-state diode reverse polarization voltage is
disturbed by a voltage pulse. This voltage pulse reduces the electric field in
the space charge region and allows free carriers from the semiconductor bulk to
penetrate this region and recharge the defects causing their non-equilibrium charge
state. After the pulse, when the voltage returns to its steady-state value, the defects
start to emit trapped carriers due to the thermal emission process. The technique
observes the device space charge region capacitance where the defect charge state
recovery causes the capacitance transient. The voltage pulse followed by the defect
charge state recovery are cycled allowing an application of different signal
processing methods for defect recharging process analysis. The emission rate is
temperature dependent and characteristic for each type of defect. From the temperature
dependence of the emission rate the activation energy of a deep level can be deduced.

In this example we demonstrate how to simulate capacitance variation versus
time and temperature on a 4H-SiC Schottky barrier Diode (SBD). To do so we used
the loop statement combined with the set statement to run multiple simulations
at different temperature and save files accordingly.
</p>
<p>
From the simulation results we also show how to simulate temperature dependence
of the capacitance difference (extracted at 2 different simulation time i.e 20ms
in that case). In this input deck carrier capture cross section
<b> SIGN </b> and
<b> SIGP </b> were set to 5.6e-15 but could easily be changed to verify emission rate is
temperature dependent
</p>
<p>
Simulation results agree very well with DLTS theory.
