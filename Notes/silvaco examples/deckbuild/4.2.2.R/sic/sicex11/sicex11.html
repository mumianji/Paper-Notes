By default Victory Process and Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot;</b> could be specidied in the
<b> go</b> statement starting Victory Process or Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
The following example shows comparison between 2D and 3D breakdown voltage simulation of a vertical SiC MOSFET.
</p>
<p>
The 3D layout-driven structure is created using Victory Process. 3D device simulation
is done using Victory Device built-in extended precision numeric.
</p>
<p>
Hatakeyama, et al. [1] have developed an anisotropic impact ionization model for materials with
a hexagonal crystal structure, including 4H-SiC. The ionization coefficients in this model
depend on the strength of the electric field and on the orientation of the field with respect
to the optical axis of the crystal.
</p>
<p>
You can specify the orientation of the optical axis of the crystal in Victory Device by supplying values for
<b> ZETA </b> and
<b> THETA </b> parameters on a
<b> MATERIAL </b> statement. ZETA defines the angle the optical axis makes with the downwards axis. THETA
defines the angle that the projection of the optical axis onto the horizontal plane makes with
respect to the right pointing axis (measured counter-clockwise). The defaults are zeta=0 degrees
and theta=0 degrees, making the &lt;0001&gt; direction downward into the Substrate (which is
usually what you want).
</p>
<p>
As expected the breakdown voltage is the same in 2D and 3D for the same structure.
