By default Victory Process and Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot;</b> could be specified in the
<b> go</b> statement starting Victory Process or Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
The following example demonstrates the effect of the shape of a trench on IV and
BV characteristics.
</p>
<p>
The 3D layout-driven structure is created using Victory Process. 3D device simulation
is done using Victory Device built-in extended precision numeric.
</p>
<p>
In this example we compare 3 different structures. One fully Manhattan (i.e right
angle layout and trench) versus 2 structures one having rounded layout and another
one having rounded layout and angled trench.
</p>
<p>
Aluminum implantation is simulated in 1D (to save simulation time) in Athena using
Monte Carlo implantation before being imported in the 3D structure using the
<b> PROFILE </b> statement in Victory Process.
</p>
<p>
The 3D structure is meshed to a full 3D Delaunay mesh using Victory Mesh.
Different options are available in order to optimize the mesh under the gate
and at the p/n junction. This 3D refinement is fully automatic.
</p>
<p>
The 3D structure is then loaded in Victory Device. The default 3D Delaunay
discretization method combined with a parallelized iterative solver set by
<b> PAM.MPI </b> statement in Victory Device allow good convergence, speed and accurate results.
</p>
<p>
Victory Device automatically sets the optical axis downwards toward the SiC surface.
This is important for anisotropic models such as anisotropic impact ionization, which
treat one direction (downwards, along the optical axis in this case) differently than
the others.
</p>
<p>
We can clearly see the effect of the trench shape on the IDVG and BV characteristics.
Indeed a known &quot;hump&quot; effect is observed on the IDVG characteristic especially
on the device with full Manhattan shape. However this parasitic effect is removed
with the device using rounded layout and angled trench.
</p>
<p>
BV simulation reveals that the breakdown voltage can be increased by 30% using
rounded layout and angled trench due to impact ionization not occurring anymore
only at the corner of the trench.
