This example demonstrates simulation of Reverse I-V and Breakdown curves of two types of SiC devices:
- 4H-SiC Schottky Barrier Diode (SBD), and
- 4H-SiC Junction Barrier Schottky (JBS) diode,
using an anisotropic impact ionization model specific for SiC.
</p>
<p>
The input deck provided with this example can be run by either Victory Device or Atlas simulator, by changing the solver name in the command
<b> go victorydevice </b> into
<b> go atlas</b> . It shows that both device simulator frameworks can be fully compatible in terms of input commands, producing same results, and allowing easy transition between Atlas and Victory Device.

Experimental data from [1] (Fig. 9) are provided with the example and plotted along with the TCAD simulation results, demonstrating a very good match with the measured reverse I-V and breakdown curves.
</p>
<p>
The simulation is run using 80-bit precision, by setting the option:
</p>
<b>   simflags=&quot;-80&quot;</b> <p>
The structure files of each device, SBD and JBS, in equilibrium and in breakdown, are saved and can be viewed in
<b> Tonyplot</b> . You can view internal physical variables inside the devices, such as electric field, impact generation rates, current density distribution, etc. Overlaid I-V plots can be plotted by using
<b> Overlay </b> feature in
<b> TonyPlot</b> .
