This example is based on the following paper submitted by
<b> AIST </b> Japan:
&quot;4.3 m-ohm.cm2, 1100 V 4H-SiC Implantation and Epitaxial MOSFET&quot;,
Shinsuke Harada et. al., Material Science Forum Vols. 527-529 (2006)
pp 1281-1284.
</p>
<p>
The paper investigated the effect of a Nitrogen implant in the surface of the
lightly doped drain region, that was the electrical N-type doping connection
to the main vertical drift region to the back of the device where the drain
contact resides.  In order to allow users to experiment with this n-type
doping concentration, this concentraion was defined as a variable called
<b> &quot;CN&quot; </b> near the begining of the input file.  In the example, this doping
concentration was set to the near optimal value of
<b> 1e17/cm3</b> .
</p>
<p>
For large band-gap semiconductors, it is necessary to use extended precision
when simulating the device in the &quot;off&quot; condition, such as when simulating
breakdown.  In this example,
<b> 160 bit precision </b> is used, which is defined in
the &quot;go atlas&quot; statement at the begining of the input file.  For the
simulation of the I-V curves, it is not strictly necessary however, but it is
still used here for completeness.
</p>
<p>
The &quot;
<b>mesh</b> &quot; startement defines the width of the device.
In order to convert the simulated currents into Amps/cm2 used in the paper,
the 1.5um gate length device needs to be multiplied by 6.67e7 um.
</p>
<p>
One of the features of SiC/oxide interface is the very high density of
<b> interface states </b> under the gate, which dominate the determination of the
threshold voltage.  Most publications place the typical interface state
density as high as 1e14/cm2/eV at the band edges, dropping to a near constant
value of 2e11/cm2/eV throughout the rest of the band gap that is more than
0.5eV away from each of the band edges.  These interface states are modelled
using the &quot;
<b>intdefects</b> &quot; statement.
</p>
<p>
The high density of interface states, effectively turn off the channel,
naturally creating a normally off (enhancement mode) device with a high
threshold voltage.  In order to reduce the threshold voltage to the more
acceptable 3.4 volts required for this paper, an n-type channel implant is
required, with a surface concentraion as high as 1.2e17/cm3 as specified in
the paper.  Using this surface implant specified in the paper and the
distribution of interfaces states found in the open literature, the correct
threshold voltage of 3.4 volts was obtained.
</p>
<p>
Finally, very tight tollerances are applied to the solution using the &quot;
<b>method</b> &quot; statement, which force the simulator to resolve currents down to
approximately 1e-30 amps, which is necessary to accurately account for
leakage currents.
