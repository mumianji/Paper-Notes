This example demonstrates 3D SiC MOSFET simulation using DEVICED3D.
</p>
<p>
Since the 3D MOSFET in this example has a rectangular shape Device 3D can be used to both create
the 3D structure and perform the device simulation. Device simulation were performed using extended
precision arithmetic to be sure to resolve low intrinsic carrier concentration. 80 bits was used for IV curves
whereas 128 and 160 bits were used for breakdown Voltage simulation. The purpose of using two different
precision arithmetic was to show that we can get the same Breakdown Voltage for both precision. However
using 128bits(compare to 160 bits) reduces simulation time but prevent to captur very low leakage current.
