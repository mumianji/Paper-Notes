This example demonstrates simulation of a reverse SiC PiN Diode characteristic
versus different levels of arithmetic precision.
</p>
<p>
Simulation of wide band gap semiconductor devices is challenging mainly
because the intrinsic carrier concentration is small. One solution to
overcome this problem is to artificially increase the intrinsic carrier
concentration. A more rogorous method consists of using different levels
of arithmetic precision.
</p>
<p>
For well-converged solutions, run-time increases with precision. The
increase is especially significant at the highest precision levels.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, certain problems (e.g. SiC devices) that have difficulty
converging at the lower precision levels are likely to run faster if the
precision level is increased. Accordingly, the optimum precision level for
a particular problem is likely to be the minimum level that yields good
convergence during the solution.
</p>
<p>
The maximum precision that may be required for a well-converged solution can
be estimated from the semiconductor bandgap. However, it is often possible to
simulate a given device, under particular bias conditions, using a precision
less than this maximum. Conversely, we can say that a given precision level
is supportive of bandgaps up to a certain value, and convergence may be
difficult if materials with higher bandgaps are simulated.
</p>
<p>
SiC may need to be simulated using a nominal precision of 256-bits.
However in this example and as mentionned above 128 bits precision
is enough in this case.
</p>
<p>
In the first part of the input deck a simple SiC PiN diode is created.
Then multiple breakdown voltage simulations are performed with different
levels of arithmetic precision. The level of arithmetic precision is set
in Atlas using the
<b> simflags=&quot;-128&quot; </b> parameter in the
<b> go atlas </b> statement for a 128 bits precision.
</p>
<p>
All the simulation were performed with the
<b> SiC anisotropic Impact Ionization model </b> </p>
<p>
Simulation time are extracted for all simulations in deckbuild using
<b> extract name=&quot;t&quot; clock.time </b> </p>
<p>
The results are plotted and overlayed in tonyplot showing that the
Breakdown Voltage is independent of the precision used during the
simulation. As mentionned above the 128 bits precision is enough to
allow accurate simulation of the leakage current.
</p>
<p>
It is also interesting to notice that the simulation time as a
function of precision exhibits a bell shape and confirm what we
mentioned above.
