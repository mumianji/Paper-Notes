This example simulates a Gummel plot for a silicon BJT in 2D and 3D. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Formation of a 2D NPN BJT using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Ic and Ib extraction versus Vbe (Gummel plot) of the 2D structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Formation of a 3D NPN BJT using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Ic and Ib extraction versus Vbe (Gummel plot) of the 3D structure
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The initial stage of the example uses the
<b> mesh, region</b> , and
<b> electrode </b> statements in Atlas to construct the 2D NPN structure.  Analytical doping profiles are added in the
<b> doping </b> statement. The structure has a heavy n+ emitter, 1.0e18 peak base
concentration, a buried collector layer and heavy p+ extrinsic base
contact.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> models bipolar </b> statement is set to specify that the default set of bipolar models is
to be used.  The default set of bipolar models includes: concentration
dependent mobility, field dependent mobility, band-gap narrowing,
concentration dependent lifetimes and Auger recombination.
</p>
<p>
The gummel plot syntax is similar to that described in the first
example of this section.  Following the calculation of the gummel plot
for the 2D structure,
<b> go atlas </b> triggers the initiation of an Atlas run that will be used to perform
an equivalent calculation in 3D.  The 3D mode of Atlas is triggered
by the inclusion of the
<b> three.d </b> parameter on the
<b> mesh </b> statement.  The extent in the z-direction is set by the
<b> z.mesh </b> statements.  The syntax for the remainder of the input is similar
to that used in 2D.
</p>
<p>
Following the completion of the calculation of the Gummel plot
for the 3D structure, the characteristics of the two structures
are plotted for comparison.
