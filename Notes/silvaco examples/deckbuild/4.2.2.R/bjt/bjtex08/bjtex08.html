This example demonstrates the formation and characterization of a PNP
bipolar transistor. It consists of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Structure formation in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
  Gummel plot simulation in Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
  Ic/Vce simulation in Atlas
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first part of this input file uses Athena to construct the
geometry and doping of the PNP transistor. The device is a polysilicon
emitter PNP with an emitter length of 0.4um. Since the device is
symmetrical through the center of the emitter, only half the device
needs to be simulated. The resulting currents from Atlas can always be
doubled to account for this reflection. The intrinsic base is formed by
a 100keV  phosphorus implant at the start of the process. Extrinsic
base is formed by spacers on the sidewall of the emitter polysilicon.
The emitter area is formed by p+ doped polysilicon directly deposited
onto the silicon.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the process, metal contacts are patterned to give an
emitter contact on top of the polysilicon and a base contact to the
right. These metal regions are defined as electrodes in Athena to
prepare the structure for Atlas.
</p>
<p>
The final step in the process simulation is to extract some process
parameters. The base width is extracted by measuring the base/collector
and emitter/base junctions individually and subtracting the two
results. Using the 1D Poisson solver in DeckBuild, the sheet resistances
of the base and polysilicon emitter region are obtained.
</p>
<p>
The first of the two Atlas runs in this file is to extract the Gummel
plot characteristics. From this plot the gain and fT can be obtained. The
material parameters for polysilicon and silicon regions are set in
separate lines in the Atlas input file.
</p>
<p>
The material parameters for polysilicon reflect the low mobility and
short carrier lifetimes seen in this material. They also contribute to
the reduction in base current and consequent increase in gain seen in
polysilicon emitter bipolar transistors. The effect of the native oxide
layer that exists between the polysilicon and silicon is emulated by
these material parameters.  The effect of the native oxide is to force
recombination of carriers at the polysilicon/silicon interface rather
than the carriers diffusing further in to emitter region. The short
lifetime and low mobility in the polysilicon accomplish the same
effect and have been widely used in polysilicon emitter bipolar device
simulation.
</p>
<p>
The Gummel plot is simulated at Vce=-2.0V by ramping Vbe from -0.4 to
-1.0V. In addition to the DC solution, a small AC signal is also
applied. This enables fT vs. Ic to be extracted.  The AC signal is
specified using the parameter AC on the
<b> solve </b> statement. The frequency
of this signal is 1MHz. At the end of the solve sequence several device
parameters are extracted: peak gain, peak collector current and peak
fT.
</p>
<p>
The second Atlas run extracts a family of Ic/Vce curves for different
base currents. For each curve it is necessary to force a constant
current through the base electrode. This is done using the current
boundary condition set by
<b> contact name=base current</b> .
</p>
<p>
Since the base currents used are quite high, it is easier to first ramp
the base voltage up close to the initial current level required. In
this case Vbe is ramped to -0.7V. Then the current boundary conditions
are applied and solutions for base currents of 1uA/um to 5uA/um were
obtained. At each step in Ib a solution file is stored for later use.
</p>
<p>
During the ramp up and storing of files with different Ib the collector
voltage is left at ground. Next a sequence of statements is used to
LOAD the stored file for a particular Ib value, open a
<b> log </b> file for the
results, and
<b> solve </b> a ramp of collector voltage to -5V. This sequence is
repeated for each Ib considered. Separate results files for each Ib
value are recommended for use in TonyPlot and for extracting parameters
from the results. It is possible to store all IV data output for this
simulation into one file. A full bipolar extraction for SPICE models
can be done by interfacing these log files with UTMOST.
</p>
<p>
Finally some extraction on the Ic/Vce data with Ib=5uA/um is done. The
peak current in mA, the peak slope in the linear region and the slope
of the saturation region can all be obtained using
<b> extract.</b> </p>
