This example demonstrates the processing, remeshing and electrical test
of a poly silicon emitter NPN bipolar transistor. Design parameters are
finally extracted from the IV Curve, including fT and Gain. This
example demonstrates the use of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Process simulation of a polysilicon emitter bipolar device
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Re-meshing of the structure in DevEdit
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 DC ramp of Vbe with fixed Vce 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simultaneous AC simulation during Vbe ramp
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Extraction of peak gain and fT
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The file starts with the definition of the process flow for an NPN
bipolar transistor in Athena. The first boron implant forms the
intrinsic base region. A second boron implant is self-aligned to the
polysilicon emitter region to form a connection between the intrinsic
base and p+ base contact regions. Spacer-like structures are used on
the side of the poly emitter to space the p+ base contact and provide
self-alignment. During the simulation, the
<b> relax </b> statement is used to reduce the mesh density in the deep regions of the
structure. Only half of the full device is simulated. Mirroring of this
half device into a full structure is performed with
<b> structure mirror left</b> . The final stage of the Athena syntax defines the electrode positions.
In this example only one base contact is used. A subsequent example
describes how two base contacts can be specified and linked together.

Often a mesh that is used for process simulation is not optimal for
use with device simulation. In this example, the mesh generation tool
<b> DevEdit </b> is used to recreate a mesh that has zero obtuse triangles in the
semiconductor region. It is then refined as a function of a number of
solution quantities on the mesh (eg: boron conc).

Popup windows under the DeckBuild Command window were used to create this
set of commands to control DevEdit.  To switch to  DevEdit Commands,
select the current simulator to DevEdit from the Main Control window.
Further use of DevEdit in more advanced applications is shown in later
examples.

<p>
In Atlas the solution procedure starts with a solution for a collector bias
of 2V. Next, the
<b> log </b> statement is used to specify a file for collection of Gummel plot
data.  The Gummel data is collected by applying a bias ramp on the
base electrode up to 0.9.  The parameter
<b> ac </b> on the solve statement sets the ac analysis on. The frequency of this
signal is set to 1MHz. Once the bias ramp is completed the data is
plotted using TonyPlot.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the
<b> extract </b> statement is used to extract the maximum gain, &quot;maxgain&quot;, and the maximum
ft, &quot;maxft&quot;, for the BJT.  The extracted parameters may be used as
optimization targets for simulator tuning.
