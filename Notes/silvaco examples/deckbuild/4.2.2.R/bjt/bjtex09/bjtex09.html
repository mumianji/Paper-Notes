This simulation shows a transient process of gate switching in an ECL
circuit. A SPICE-like circuit description is used by Atlas/MIXEDMODE to
specify two ECL inverters. Two NPN transistors modeled using device
simulation are included in the circuit alongside two devices simulated
using a simple SPICE model. This example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Specification of an NPN device using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of an ECL inverter circuit using MIXEDMODE netlist syntax.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Inclusion of two SPISCES devices within the SPICE circuit.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of device simulation models and parameters in MIXEDMODE syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of the DC initial bias point
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of transient switching characteristics
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example file consists of three runs. The first uses Atlas syntax
to define the NPN device geometry, mesh and doping, the second sets up
the MIXEDMODE circuit to simulate the initial DC bias point, the third
performs the transient circuit simulation using Atlas/MIXEDMODE.
</p>
<p>
The first run uses Atlas syntax to define the NPN structure. There are two identical NPN devices in the ECL circuit. Both devices can be loaded from a single mesh file
<b> bjtex09_0.str</b> .
</p>
<p>
The second run starts with a netlist description of the ECL circuit.
For details of the syntax used in MIXEDMODE, see the MIXEDMODE
section of Atlas  Manual. The key non-standard element in the circuit
is the Atlas device. These are circuit elements where Atlas device
simulation is used to give the terminal characteristics as opposed to
a SPICE model equation. The primitives letter
<b> a </b> is used to identify these devices. In this example there are two such
primitives; ai and an. There are also two more NPN bipolar transistors
simulated using the SPICE model modbjt. These are labeled qi and qn.
</p>
<p>
After the
<b> .end </b> statement, regular SPISCES syntax is used to define parameters for the device simulation.
<b> models </b> is used to set the physical models to be used in each of the devices to
be modeled by device simulation. Note the use of the
<b> device=&lt;name&gt; </b> parameter. This is compulsory in MIXEDMODE simulation to identify the
device to which these parameters are applied. This is true even if only
one device simulation element exists in the circuit.
