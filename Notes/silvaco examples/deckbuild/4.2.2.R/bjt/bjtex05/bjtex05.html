This example calculates the BVCEO breakdown voltage in an NPN
transistor. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Formation of an NPN BJT using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of the correct models and methods for breakdown simulation
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting of current boundary conditions to force an open base contact 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Ic extraction versus Vce with an open base contact 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In the first part of the input file the device is described, including
mesh, electrodes location, and doping distribution. The device geometry
and doping are as used in the previous example.
</p>
<b>The  impact statement is used to specify the Selberherr impact</b> <p>
ionization model required for breakdown analysis.
</p>
<p>
For increased stability which is typically needed for such kind of simulation
with zero base current, the solution with small value of base current
Ib=3.e-15 A/um is obtained at the first stage of simulation. Then the
collector voltage is ramped until the collector current reaches the
value 5.e-11 A/um.
</p>
<p>
To set the open base contact, it is necessary to define zero current
passing through the base electrode. This is done by setting current
boundary conditions on the base using
<b> contact name=base current</b> . Then throughout the breakdown simulation Ib is held at zero. This is
the most effective approach for BVCEO simulation.
</p>
<p>
The ramp of collector voltage is set on the final
<b> solve </b> statement. The ramp continues up to 10V. However a compliance limit on the collector current is set using the parameters
<b> compl=&lt;num&gt; cname=collector</b> . The &lt;num&gt; specifies the value of the compliance limit in A/um, whilst
the cname indicates which contact the complaince current should be
measured on. Once the simulated collector current exceeds the
complaince value the simulation steps on to the next line of syntax.
Here that line is to plot the results in TonyPlot.
