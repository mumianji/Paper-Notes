This example demonstrates the effect of n-type doping on Zinc diffusion in InP.
</p>
<p>
It has been found that the main diffusion mechanism for Zn in A3B5 compounds
is via doubly charged interstitial pairs. This means that Zn diffusivity is
proportional to the second power of hole concentrations. Therefore, high
background n-type doping concentration results in strong retardation of zinc
diffusion. Also, the Zn diffusion profile drops abruptly when n- and p-type
concentrations are close to each other near the pn-junction. The diffusivity
coefficients DIPP.0 and DIPP.E are selected to approximately match experimental
data from G.J. van Gurp et.al. J. Appl. Phys., v.61(5), p.1846 (1987).
</p>
<p>
The simulation results for high n-type levels are in a reasonable agreement
with the experiments from this paper as well. Other effects may influence
these simulations. For example, the activation mechanism in this case can
be much more complicated than that based on the simple solid solubility
level set to 1e19 for all impurities. There is evidence that the solid
solubility of Zn may depend on n-type doping level as well. In any case, this
example is a good starting point for calibration of impurity diffusion effects
in A3B5 compounds.
