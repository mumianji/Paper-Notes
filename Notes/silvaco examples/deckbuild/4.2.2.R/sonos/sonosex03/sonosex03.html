The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 How to create a SONOS device structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 How to charge and then erase the device 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Use of PROBE statement to obtain stored charge density
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example illustrates how the position of the trapped charges in
the Silicon Nitride vary with time as the device is charged up and then
erased by changing the Gate Bias.  This example has a 2 nm thick
tunnelling layer, a 5 nm Nitride layer and a 5 nm blocking oxide layer.
</p>
<p>
The NITRIDECHARGING statement sets up a density of 10^20 /cm^3 of electron
traps, having a relatively high capture cross-section of 10^-10 cm^2.
A bias of 18 V is applied to the gate and the device is charged up.  The
state of the structure is saved out to a structure file at certain
values of charge time. It is charged for 1.0 seconds, after which SOLVE
INIT is called, with the SONOS parameter specified.
</p>
<p>
SOLVE INIT preserves the stored charge density,  but on its own tries
to put in the steady state equibrium solution.  The combination of a
large fixed charge, and weak coupling of the drift-diffusion equations
through the wide band-gap semiconductors,  can result in erroneous
free carrier screening of the fixed charge.  The SONOS parameter used with
SOLVE INIT avoids this.
</p>
<p>
After this, negative bias is applied to the gate, ramping for 1 nanosecond
and then the device is erased for 1.0 seconds.  The structure file is
output at preset intervals in order to allow the user to inspect the
progress of the erasing.
</p>
<p>
The integrated nett stored charge in C/um is obtained using the PROBE statement
</p>
<b> PROBE NAME=nettcharge SONOS.CHARGE INTEGRATE  Y.MIN=-0.0075 Y.MAX=-0.0015 X.MIN=0.1 X.MAX=0.2 </b> <p>
and this quantity can be plotted as a function of time.  When the device is
charged, the largest contribution is from the tunnel current into the
Nitride conduction band.  For erase, it is the tunnelling direct from the traps
to the channel. This is illustrated by doing a second erase,  with the only
change being the parameter ELEC.DEPTH in the NITRIDECHARGING statement.
This is increased from 1.5 eV to 2.0 eV, in order to reduce the direct
trap-to-channel tunnel current.  It can be seen from the log file that
the erase takes longer with deeper traps.
</p>
<p>
The user can employ the TonyPlot cutline tool to see the vertical profile
of the Trapped Nitride Charge through the gate stack at various time points
of the charging/erasing.
