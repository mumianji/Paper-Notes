<p>
Typical Atlas meshing commands are used to set up a MOSFET-like
structure. The main difference is the presence of a layer of Silicon
Nitride in the gate stack.  The insulating layer between the Nitride and the
channel is termed the tunnel oxide,  and the insulating layer between
the Nitride and the contacts is called the blocking layer.  The Atlas
SONOS model is invoked using the
<b> INTERFACE N.I DYNASONOS </b> statement.  The value of DYNASONOS flag is enabed by default,  and so
it is not necessary to specify this explicitly.
</p>
<p>
To use the DYNASONOS model, the insulators in the gate stack must be changed
to (wide-gap) semiconductors and given values for density of states, mobility
and effective mass.  The effective mass values strongly affect the tunneling
current through the gate stack.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, one must use the NITRIDECHARGE statement to set up the parameters
of the nitride traps.  The density of traps can be set with the parameters
NT.N (acceptor-like traps) and NT.P (donor-like traps). In this deck we
want to trap electrons and so specify a non-zero value for NT.N. The
parameter SIGMAT.N gives the cross-section for trapping the electrons in the
Nitride conduction band and is set to 4 different values within this deck.
</p>
<p>
The parameter ELEC.DEPTH specifies the energy depth of the electron
trap below the conduction band.  The parameter TAU.N gives the characteristic
timescale for emission from the trap level to the conduction band.
</p>
<p>
The parameter SIGMAN.P controls hole capture from the valence band and is
set to zero with loss of generality.
</p>
<p>
The Nitride traps are charged up by ramping the bias to 16 V over 1 nanosecond
and then maintaining this for 1 millisecond.
</p>
<p>
The stored charge as a function of time (nettcharge) is plotted for the four
different values of SIGMAT.N.  The larger the cross-section then the
more charge is stored.  The stored charge should be the integrated
difference between the current entering the Nitride region from the
channel and that leaving to the gate contact.  This can also be seen in the
other plots, and by using the TonyPlot integrate tool you can obtain an
estimate of the nett stored charge to compare (within truncation errors)
with nett charge.
</p>
<p>
As the trapping cross-section increases, less charge arrives at the interface
with the blocking insulator and the out current decreases and is delayed,
as can be seen in the plots of in and out current at the different values of
capture cross-section.  In all cases a steady state is obtained where
in and out current are matched and the nett charge is constant.
</p>
<p>
The structure files of the charged device are plotted, the user can use the
TonyPlot cutline tool to view the Trapped Insulator Charge, Electron Charging
Rate and other relevant parameters
