<ul>
  <li>
 How to set up a SANOS device (variant of a SONOS device)
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 How to obtain the threshold Voltage of a SANOS device
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 How to obtain data for a range of Biases and time frames

The blocking insulator need not be made of the same material as the
tunnelling insulator.  In this case we have a blocking insulator made
of Sapphire (Al203) and a tunnelling insulator made of Silicon dioxide.
</p>
<p>
This example uses the DBINTERNAL feature of DeckBuild, and the deck
sonosex02_aux.in is run for each value of the Gate Bias specified by
the parameter sweep of vgate in the sonosex02.in deck.
</p>
<p>
Each time sonosex02_aux.in is run,  it sets up a SANOS structure, very
similar to the structure in sonosex01.in , but with the blocking insulator
layer made of Sapphire.  It is necessary to make this material into a widegap
semiconductor and set other parameters on the MATERIAL statement.
</p>
<p>
The DYNASONOS model is selected on the first INTERFACE statement.  Because
of the relatively low conduction band offset between the Silicon Nitride
and the sapphire,  the
<b> INTERFACE S.S THERMIONIC</b> statement is used to model any thermionically emitted current leaving the
device.  This current will not appear in the SONOS outcurrent, but in the
gate conduction current.
</p>
<p>
In the
<b> NITRIDECHARGE</b> statement, we set up the relevant parameters
and also specify
<b> PF.BARRIER.</b> This sets the barrier height for the
Poole-Frenkel detrapping model, which is enabled by the PF.NITRIDE flag
on the MODELS statement.
</p>
<p>
The gate bias is ramped and the device charged for 1 second.  A structure file
is saved out at various preset charging times.  The next part of the deck
reads in these structure files in turn, and for each one it ramps the drain
bias and also the gate bias in order to calculate the threshold voltage using the
deckbuild EXTRACT facility.  The gate stack layers are treated as insulators
in this case, to make the simulation simpler.  The charge trapped in the
Nitride layer affects the threshold voltage in the same way.
</p>
<p>
After calculating the threshold voltage for the set of Gate biases and at each
of the preset charging times,  the threshold data is plotted.  The threshold voltage
increases with Gate Bias and also with charging time.  For a charging
time of 1.0 seconds there is a roughly linear relationship between gate bias
and threshold voltage (0.65 V of threshold voltage change for every 1.0 V of
bias volatge change).  The threshold voltage for the uncharged device is also
shown, and threshold volatge shifts can be calculated relative to this.
