The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 How to use the simplified SONOS model
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 How to charge the device using hot carrier gate current
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 How to erase the device using tunnelling
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The device is set up in a similar way to the DYNASONOS model.  The main
difference is that the gate stack materials remain as insulators,
they are not changed to wide bandgap semiconductors. The gate material
parameters which will affect the simulation are the tunnel insulator
effective masses, and the bandgap and affinity parameters.
</p>
<p>
In this example case a device with a a 5/15/10 nm ONO gate stack is
constructed.  It is still necessary to specify N.I on the INTERFACE
statement,  but the DYNASONOS model must be explicitly cleared by
using the syntax ^DYNASONOS.  The NITRIDECHARGE statement is not required.
</p>
<p>
In this example the N.CONCANNON parameter on the MODELS statement is
set, and this also has the effect of enabling the Hot Electron energy
balance model. The gate is given a positive bias, in order to attract
hot electrons leaving the channel.  The drain is then biased to half
of the gate bias and the hot electrons follow field lines until they
either leave the device or charge the traps at the edges of the Nitride
region.
</p>
<p>
After the device is charged the threshold voltage is obtained.  The structure
field is also saved, enabling you to look at the trapped charge under
the &quot;Insulator Charge&quot; field, in units of cm^2.
</p>
<p>
The device is then erased by applying a negative bias to the gate, with
drain and source grounded.  The structure file is saved and the threshold
voltage measured.
</p>
<p>
The Idrain versus Vgate plots are shown for the uncharged, charged and
erased state of the device.
