# Here we specify a mesh of one square meter ( 1um x 1e12 um).
# Since the structure is essentially one dimensional we ignore
# variations if x and z.
#
mesh width=1e12
x.mesh l=0 s=1
x.mesh l=1 s=1
#
# In the Y direction we define a finer mesh to resolve variations due
# to the exponential variation of absorption and carrier distributions
# due to diffusion in opposite directions.
#
y.mesh l=0.00  s=0.001
y.mesh l=0.12  s=0.001

# For organic solar cells we define only a single organic region that
# represents a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) material.
#
region number=1 material=Organic
#
# Here we define the top and bottom electrodes which we define workfunctions
# in order to provice a build-in field for separation of electrons and holes.

# We define the models.  In this case we specify that we will solve for
# the singlet equation (singlet), accounting for Langevin recombination
# (langevin) and singlet exciton dissociation (s.dissoc).

#
# The parameter qe.exciton specifies the number of excitons generated for
# for each absorbed photon.

# This statement sets up some of the standard material parameters for the
# organic material (permittivity, affinity, band gap (difference between
# LUMO and HOMO) and densities of states.

# Parameters appearing on the method statement refer to numerical
# adjustments that are usually not required except to improve
# robustness or speed of solution.
# In this case we are specifying climit which controls the minimum
# resolvable carrier concentration and maxtrap which specifies the
# maximum number of cutbacks during any solve.

# Now we open a log file to capture the IV data.
