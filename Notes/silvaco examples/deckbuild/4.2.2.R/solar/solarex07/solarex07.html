This example demonstrates the use of singlet exciton dissociation in
the modeling of organic/polymer solar cell devices.  This model may
also be used to model organic/polymer imaging sensors.
</p>
<p>
The modeling of organic solar cells through exciton dissociation
is based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept.  In this model
we do not consider the details of the location of the heterointerface
as it is considered as a random interpenetrating mixture of materials.
</p>
<p>
Instead we assume the material is electrically uniform and that the
mean distance from anywhere to the heterointerface is characterized
in the dissociation model by the
<b> A.SINGLET </b> parameter of the
<b> MATERIAL </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
There are three keys for simulation of exciton dissociation.  They
are the inclusion of the singlet exciton continuity equation, the
inclusion of Langevin recombination and the inclusion of the singlet
dissociation model.  These three models are enabled on the
<b> MODEL </b> statement by the parameters
<b> SINGLET</b> ,
<b> LANGEVIN </b> and
<b> S.DISSOC</b> .
</p>
<p>
Another consideration unique to organic photodetection is characterized
by the
<b> QE.EXCITON </b> parameter of the
<b> MATERIAL </b> statement.  This
parameter characterizes the number of singlet excitons generated for each
photon that is absorbed.  Absorbed photons not generating singlets
generate electron-hole pairs.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you should notice that the photogeneration rate is specified
in the C-interpreter function
<b> solarex07.lib</b> .  This was done as
a simple means to introduce a uniform photogeneration rate in the material.
This is sometimes necessary if for example we do not know the details
of the extinction coefficient versus wavelength for the materials involved.
