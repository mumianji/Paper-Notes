This example shows how a solar cell structure can be simulated in
Athena and Atlas. The structure used and the results obtained are
similar to those in the book &quot;VLSI Technology&quot; by Sze. The example file
consists of:
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of solar cell doping and geometry in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of short circuit current
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of open circuit voltage
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of spectral response
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of illuminated and unilluminated IV characteristics
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The initial part of the example file uses Athena to create a typical
solar cell structure. The device used is a diode of n+ over a p
substrate. The junction depth is approx 0.25um. A single contact is
placed in the center of the structure. Typical solar cells will have
this structure repeated many times across a large area. Here
advantage is taken of the reflecting boundary conditions at the edges of the
structure to simulate just one cathode contact.
</p>
<p>
The process consists of an implant and diffusion followed by electrode
formation. The electrode statement is then used to define the
electrodes for Atlas.
</p>
<p>
The first Atlas run in the file simulates the response of the device to
illumination by the solar spectrum. The material parameters for the
structure are set at the start of the file . The imaginary refractive
index (which is directly related to the absorption coefficient) of the
metal is defined to a high value to ensure it is opaque to the
incident radiation.
</p>
<p>
The illumination by solar spectrum is defined by the
<b> beam </b> statement.
The origin and angle of incidence need to be defined. An angle of 90
degrees means normal incidence from the top. The parameter
<b> power.file</b> points to an external file that contains a list of wavelengths vs.
intensity.  The file &apos;solarex01.spec&apos; contains data for the Air Mass Zero
Solar Spectrum. The intensity in the file can be considered just as
relative intensity between the wavelengths.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to store the optical intensity of the illumination by
specifying
<b> output opt.int </b> at any time before saving a structure file.
The photogeneration rate will appear in the solution structure file
by default.
</p>
<p>
The short circuit current is the current when the anode and cathode are
shorted. This is simulated by illuminating the device with zero voltage
on all contacts. The B&lt;n&gt; parameter of the
<b> solve </b> statement sets the
power of the light. An
<b> extract </b> statement is used to
measure the short circuit current. An extracted target like this can be
used for optimization or as targets in VWF.
</p>
<p>
The system is reset using the command &apos;solve init&apos; for the second test.
To simulate open circuit voltage, the current through the device is
forced to be zero. The device is illuminated and the voltage sustained
across the device is measured.
</p>
<p>
To set the current to zero it is first necessary to set one electrode
to have current boundary conditions. This is performed on the cathode using
the
<b> current </b> parameter of the
<b> contact </b> statement. Simulating with the
device illuminated and
<b> icathode=0 </b> gives the open circuit voltage. This
voltage is measured using the
<b> extract </b> statement. Note the use of the
syntax
<b> vint.&quot;cathode&quot; </b> as opposed to
<b> v.&quot;cathode&quot;</b> . This is necessary
when you want to extract the voltage directly on the semiconductor
contact as opposed to the applied bias.
</p>
<p>
The structure stored at this point can be plotted to show contours of
photogeneration, carrier concentration or potential. The
photogeneration contours show the effect of the opaque cathode contact.
It is also possible to show ray tracing of light beams in this file.
However in our example normal illumination was used so there are no
refractive effects to see. A similar run using non-normal incidence and
a narrower illumination spot would show the ray tracing inside the
device.
</p>
<p>
The second Atlas run in this file is used to simulate the spectral
response of the solar cell. At the start the definition of material
parameters and opaque metal contact is repeated. For this test
a different light beam is required. A beam origin and
angle of incidence are set as before. The wavelength or spectrum file is not
defined since  the wavelength is to be varied in this test.
</p>
<p>
The short circuit case is considered, so zero biases are set on both
electrodes. The parameter
<b> lambda </b> of the
<b> solve </b> statement is used to set
the wavelength of the incident light. The range of wavelength used was
300nm to 1000nm.
</p>
<p>
Plotting the resulting
<b> log </b> file it is possible to see how the cathode
current varies with wavelength. Setting a plot vs wavelength of source
photocurrent (current available in the light beam), available
photocurrent (current available for collection), and actual cathode
current can show how the device behaves. The losses between source and
available photocurrent are caused by reflections and transmission. This
dominates the losses at all except the shortest wavelengths. The losses
from available photocurrent to the actual simulated cathode current are
due to recombination. These are very low except at the extremes.
</p>
<p>
This simulation has produced all the data needed to create a plot of
efficiency vs light frequency as used in the reference.  All that is
needed is to transform the data in TonyPlot.
</p>
<p>
On the y-axis the quantum efficiency is needed. This is defined as
(current in/current out). In TonyPlot the following function is needed:
</p>
<b>Source Photocurrent/cathode current</b> <p>
.
</p>
<p>
This plot shows the same functional form as the reference material.
The peak efficiency falls off quickly at low
energies and more slowly at higher energies.
</p>
<p>
The third simulation is a plot of illuminated and un-illuminated
I-V characteristics, allowing the designer to choose a suitable load
line for the device under normal operating conditions.
A number of useful parameters are also extracted from this curve
using the extract statement.  Finally the extracted plot of external power
versus cathode voltage is displayed.
