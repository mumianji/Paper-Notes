This example is a simple demonstration of the application of
the transfer matrix method to a simple germanium solar cell.
</p>
<p>
The cell is a simple P-N germanium photo-diode capped with a
InGaP window layer.  The simulation enables transfer matrix
analysis using the
<b> TR.MAT </b> parameter on the
<b> BEAM </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The example uses the DeckBuild
<b> LOOP </b> syntax to loop over wavelengths from 0.6 to 0.7 microns.
</p>
<p>
This example is illustrative of some of the problems with interpretation
of results when using the transfer matrix method on optically thick
devices.
</p>
<p>
If you look at the plot of the spectral response of the device plotted
at the end of the simulation, you will see several peaks and valleys
in the response.  This is a real effect of interference over the whole
thickness of the device.  The thicker the device the more of these
you will see.  If you also look at the structure cross-section you
will see the intensity also includes numerous peaks and valleys.  Here
however they appear as random noise.  In fact this is an effect of
undersampling.  The actual result is continuous but the sampling
is aliasing against the peaks and valleys to give the apparent noise.
In other words the spatial domain is under-sampled.  Such noisy results
in either the spectral response or the spatial cut plane in very thick
devices are usually due to undersampling.
</p>
<p>
To get rid of this problem you can add the
<b> SUBSTRATE </b> parameter to the
<b> BEAM </b> statement.  This will make the bottom layer &quot;appear&quot; as infinite
to the transfer matrix algorithm.
