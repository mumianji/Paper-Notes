This example demonstrates 2D simulation and optimization of a n-type
Interdigitated Back Contact Silicon Heterojunction (IBC-SHJ) solar cell.
Combination of amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction and
interdigitated back contact are very promising for high efficiency one
junction solar cell.
</p>
<p>
The solar cell structure consists from top to bottom of a n-type c-Si
substrate, an intrinsic a-Si buffer layer and interdigitated strips of
p and n-type a-Si.
</p>
<p>
For a-Si layers, critical parameters like band gap, doping and defect
distribution are defined in the input deck.
</p>
<p>
For c-Si/a-Si interfaces at the back surface a thermionic emission
model was used. For even more realistic modeling of this interface
we have introduced defect states at the hetero-interface by putting
a very thin defective layer of c-Si.
</p>
<p>
Fermi model, Recombination models (i.e srh, auger and surface recombination)
Drift Diffusion model with quantum correction were used to simulate IV
characteristic of the solar cell under front surface illumination.
</p>
<p>
A complete parametrized input deck, including geometry and mesh, was created
not only to optimize simulation time and accuracy but also for solar cell
optimization purpose.
</p>
<p>
In this example 4 different parameters were varied to optimize the
solar cell efficiency. These parameters are intrinsic a-Si thickness,
n-stripe and p-strip width and gap width.
</p>
<p>
It was observed experimentally observed that an intrinsic a-Si layer increases
Voc and Jsc but also decreases FF and leads to a &quot;S&quot; shape IV curve. Simulation
results confirm the reduction of FF and &quot;S&quot; shape IV curve, as well as the
increase of Voc when the thickness of the intrinsic a-Si layer increases,
leading to an optimum efficiency of around 10nm for the intrinsic a-Si layer.
</p>
<p>
n-stripe, p-stripe and gap width were also optimized. Simulation results
show that Jsc decreases when n-stripe width and gap width increases. As
a consequence n-stripe and gap width have to be choosen as narrow as possible.
It is interesting to notice that Jsc increases and FF decreases when
p-stripe increases. The different evolution of Jsc anf FF leads to an
optimum for the efficiency of around 1mm for p-stripe width.
