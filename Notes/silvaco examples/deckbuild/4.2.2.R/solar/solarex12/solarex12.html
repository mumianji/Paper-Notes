This example demonstrates both IV and EQE simulations of a tandem
a-Si:H/uc-Si:H solar cell based on the following reference:

M.Zeman and J.Krc, &quot;Optical and electrical modeling of thin-film
silicon solar cells&quot; J. mater. res., Vol 23, No. 4, April 2008

A microphah solar cell with the following structure was used in the
simulation: ZnO:Al(500nm)/p-a-Si:H(10nm)/i-a-Si:H(200nm)/n-a-Si:H
(15nm)/p-uc-Si:H(10nm)/i-uc-Si:H(2.2um)/p-uc-Si:H(15nm)/ZnO(100nm)/Ag.

The Tauc-Lorentz dielectric function with Urbach Tail model for complex
index of refraction was used for a-Si:H material. The model parameters
were calibrated to fit the EQE of the top cell. For the bottom cell
silicon index of refraction was used except that the imaginary part
of the index of refraction was shifted in energy to take into account
the band gap difference between silicon and uc-Si:H material. No specific
calibration was performed here.

In order to model the interlayer between the two solar cells an
original and simple method was used. Note that a more physical
approach can be used as well using the NLBBT model as illustrated
in solarex03.in. The method used here consists of adding an
electrode which exactly overlay the interlayer and attaching a
lumped resistance to it using the
<b> contact name=com resist=1e16 </b> statement. In doing this, we force the current to flow from Anode
to Cathode and prevent any current to flow in the added electrode.
Physically it can be justified by the fact the interlayer is acting
like a resistor letting current flows without significant limitation.
The value of the resistance can be used to adjust the amount of
current allowing to flow through the added electrode thus controling
the interlayer resistance.

<p>
In hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), the effect of dangling-bond
states on recombination can be significant. The dangling-bond states are
amphoteric and located around the middle of the bandgap. In this example
the
<b> amphoteric</b> parameter on the
<b> defect</b> statement was used to specify amphoteric defects.
</p>
<p>
While in mechanically stacked Multi Junction cells, the subcells usually
have separate contacts, monolithic Multi Junction cells are epitaxilly
grown on one substrate, and the subcells are interconnected in series by
tunnel diodes, leading to a standard two terminal contact. Thus the subcells
are not accessible separately and the spectral response of a certain
subcell has to be measured by using the effect of current limitation.
In this example we shown how to accurately extract the spectral response
in order to compare simulation and measurement in a reliable way.
