This example shows how a TCAD solar cell can be included in a more realistic
circuit with series and shunt resistance by using MixedMode.  The solar cell is
the same as in solarex01, but with the addition of four MixedMode simulations
which are variations of the same circuit.  Also, the width is set so that the
cell has an area of 1 cm^2.  All four circuits have the same topology for
easily overlaying the output log files.  The fill factor and efficiency are
calculated for each case.
</p>
<p>
Circuit 0 is the solar cell by itself - the shunt resistance Rsh is set to 1e6
ohms and the series resistance Rs is set to 1e-6 ohms.
</p>
<p>
Circuit 1 uses a shunt resistance of 100 ohms - Rs is still set to 1e-6.
</p>
<p>
Circuit 2 uses a series resistance of 5 ohms - Rsh is set to 1e6.
</p>
<p>
Circuit 3 uses Rs=5 and Rsh=100.
</p>
<p>
The resulting log files are overlaid and the result is very much like Figure 12
on page 806 of Sze&apos;s &quot;Physics of Semiconductor Devices&quot; 2nd edition.
