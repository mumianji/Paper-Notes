This example shows the modelization of Grain Boundary in a CIGS
solar cell.
The solar cell consists of window, buffer and absopber layers and is
implemented as 200nm ZnO, 50nm Cds and 3um CIGS layer respectively,
which is typical of CIGS solar cell. Interface recombination at the
Cds/CIGS interface is included. All layers have uniform band-gap
energy versus depth. Gaussian-distributed defect states are also
considered.
</p>
<p>
Parameterized Grain Boundaries are introduced horizontally and
vertically. Meshing and regions are created automatically. Grain
Boundary are modeled by a thin layer located between two uniform
regions of CIGS material and the Grain Boundary layer differs
from the surrounding bulk material only by presence of additional
defects.
</p>
<p>
You can define the x direction grain spacing as well as the
y direction grain spacing and the grain boundary thickness at the
beginning of the input deck. This example allows the investigation
of Grain Boundaries architecture on the performance of the solar
cell.
