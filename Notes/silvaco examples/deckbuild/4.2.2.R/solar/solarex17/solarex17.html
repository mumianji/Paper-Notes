This example demonstrates the methodology to simulate EQE of
a tandem cell. This example, based on solarex03, will also show
that EQE can be simulated using a non-local band-to-band tunneling
model to model the tunnel diode in the tandem cell. An alternative
approach is also shown and consist to replace the tunnel junction
by an electrode with a very high resistance so that the current can
flow from the top cell to the bottom cell without limitation. The
results of both approaches are very similar.

In order to get EQE of the tandem cell special technique should be
used. Indeed two cells are in series, thus the current is limited
by the one that has the lowest current. The idea is to illuminate
the one we do not want to characterize by applying a monochromatic
beam with an intensity 10 times higher compared to cell under test.
2 beams were used in this input deck, one with a fixed monochromatic
wavelenght and one with a variable wavelenght to characterize the cell
under test in the tandem cell. The current resulting from the illumination
using the monochromatic beam is then substracted to the total current,
to get the current of the cell under test. EQE is obtained by
dividing the current of the cell under test by the source photo
current.
