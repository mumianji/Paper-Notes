This example simulates the structure
definition and electrical test of a FLASH EEPROM cell. The example consists of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Dual gate EEPROM structure formation in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Re-meshing in DevEdit
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Threshold voltage simulation before programming
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Transient programming simulation
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Threshold voltage simulation after programming
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Transient erasure simulation  
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For accurate simulation of programming and erasure it is vital to have
a very accurate representation of the device structure. The gate and
tunneling currents are very sensitive to geometry and doping profiles.
It will be possible for you to alter
process parameters and observe their effect on device performance
directly with this input file.
</p>
<p>
The interface between Athena and Atlas is automatic. The electrode
statements in Athena are used to define the electrode positions for
Atlas. Any metal or polysilicon layer can optionally be set as an
electrode region. The electrode names given in Athena are transferred
into Atlas.
</p>
<p>
As with many of the examples provided, the grid structure for the
example EEPROM device is rather coarse. This allows a realistic
execution times for the example. When comparing simulated and real
EEPROM devices, a finer grid is recommended. This can be done quickly by
decreasing the
<b> space.mult </b> parameter of the initialize statement.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a finer grid, DevEdit is used. This can effectively refine the
grid for the electrical simulation. A finer mesh for resolving the
dopant distribution is still recommended though.
</p>
<p>
The  Atlas programming simulation consists of 3 basic parts. Firstly a
threshold voltage simulation is done to obtain the EEPROM cell threshold in
it&apos;s unprogrammed state. Then the device is biased into the initial
condition of the transient with the high programming control gate
voltage. Here 12V is used.
</p>
<p>
Next the programming transient is performed. Since the times involved in
programming are much greater than the relaxation time of the device, the
syntax
<b> method quasi can be used to specify the quasistatic </b> method. This results in a large improvement in the speed of the
calculation.
</p>
<p>
The programming consists of two solve
statements. The first ramps the drain to 5.0V in 1ns. A solution file
is saved at this point. This can be used to examine the
potentials before charge is applied to the floating gate. The second
line gives no change in the applied voltages, it simply leaves the
device biased the condition VCG=12.0V and Vds=5.0V. During this time
the hot electron injection model will predict values of gate current.
This current coupled with the transient time step size is used to add
charge self-consistently to the floating gate. A solution file is saved
at the end of the transient.
</p>
<p>
Comparisons of device internal distributions, such as potentials can be
done by comparing the two solution files from before
programming and  after the programming.
</p>
<p>
The final part of this run consists of a copy of the first part.
A threshold voltage test is run on the EEPROM cell. In this case
however the device is programmed and a large threshold voltage shift is
seen.
</p>
<p>
The graphics output of this section shows plots of threshold voltage
before and after programming. A plot of floating gate charge vs. time
can be obtained from the result of the transient simulation. Also, the
actual programming gate current can be seen falling off with time. This
is because the increasing charge on the floating gate increases the
threshold voltage of the device. This in turn reduces the drain
current which will cause a drop in hot carrier density and hence a
reduction in programming current.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to plot the showed the floating gate charge charge vs. time curve. This can be quickly
converted to threshold voltage shift using the following formula:
</p>
<p>
Threshold Shift =   Q Tox / L Eox
</p>
<p>
Where Q = floating gate charge per unit width,
Tox  = inter-poly oxide thickness,
L = length of floating gate,
Eox = absolute permittivity of oxide.
</p>
<p>
In this case Tox is converted into an effective Tox based on the thickness
of each layer of the inter-poly ONO di-electric. This is done by:
</p>
<p>
Effective Tox = E oxide *  (Tox1/Eox1 + Tnitride/Enitride + Tox2/Eox2   )
</p>
<p>
where Tx is thickness of x and Ex is relative permittivity of x.
</p>
<p>
The final run of this example is a transient erasure simulation. Atlas is restarted using the command
<b> go atlas</b> . The correct set of erasing models for EEPROMs is chosen . The key models are
<b> fnord </b> and
<b> bbt.std</b> . fnord specifies the solution for Fowler Nordheim tunneling the main
erasure mechanism for EEPROMs. bbt.std specifies the band to band
tunneling model. This is required due to the high electric fields at
the source/channel junction. Tunneling due to these fields leads to
high substrate current during erasing.
</p>
<p>
After the models and other material parameters are set, the charge on
the floating gate is ramped using the parameter q1. This &apos;q&apos; works in
an analogous manner to ramping voltages using &apos;v&apos;: q1 and qstep are the
equivalent in charge to v1 and vstep.  In EEPROM erasure the drain is
disconnected to avoid large power consumption from source to drain
breakdown currents. One way to disable a contact is to use current
boundary conditions and force zero current. An alternative used here is
to attach a very large resistor to the contact.
</p>
<p>
The transient erasure is performed in a single solve statement. The
source electrode is ramped to 12.5V. The mechanism to remove charge
from the floating gate is exactly analogous to programming. The only
differences is the  Fowler-Nordheim tunneling rather then hot electron
injection as gate current. Obviously this will change the direction of
the current through the gate oxide.
</p>
<p>
The resultant graphics show the transient erasing characteristic. To
plot the threshold voltage shift, the same calculation given in the
programming section can be used.
