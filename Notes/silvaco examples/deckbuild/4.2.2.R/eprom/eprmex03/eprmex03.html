This example file is based upon that given in exprmex01.in but
has an additional modification to account for capacitive coupling.
A description of the standard syntax may be found in example eprmex01.in.
</p>
<p>
In a real device, the coupling between the control gate and the floating
gate is a three-dimensional problem that depends upon the layout.
As a result any two-dimensional simulation will not be able to accurately
simulate coupling capacitance. In most cases it will underestimate this value.
To take account of this problem Atlas is capable of connecting
electrodes together via some capacitor.
This effectively increases the coupling capacitance and can normally allow
accurate matching to experimental data without having to make unphysical
modifications to the structure.
</p>
<p>
This example consists of two Atlas input files. The first is a standard
calculation of the threshold voltage from which the coupling ratio may be found.
In the second, the syntax has been modified so that on the
<b> contact </b> statement a capacitance is specified between the control and floating gates.
After plotting the results it is apparent that the coupling ratio has been
increased due to the additional coupling capacitance.
This has effectively modified the threshold voltage.
