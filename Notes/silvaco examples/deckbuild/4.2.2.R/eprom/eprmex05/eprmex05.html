This example creates a simple EEPROM cell with a polysilicon floating gate.
It then highlights the difference between treating this as a floating
contact (perfect conductor) or a floating electrode (semiconductor).
It demonstrates
</p>

  <li>

  <li>

<p>
The
<b> FLOATING </b> parameter on the
<b> CONTACT </b> statement causes the specified electrode to be treated as
a perfect conductor, and therefore as an equipotential.  Any stored charge
is assumed to be evenly distributed and coupled to the device potential
by using Gauss&apos;s flux theorem. For a polysilicon electrode this can be an
imperfect approximation, because in the isolated semiconductor the potential
and charge distributions will be position dependent in order to maintain
the condition of zero steady state current flow.  The
<b> FLOATING</b> parameter on the
<b> ELECTRODE</b> statement
allows to to model the floating gate as a semiconductor.
<br/>
This example has four sections, each staring with
<br/>
<b> go atlas</b> <br/>
The first creates the EEPROM cell using Atlas syntax,  giving the polysilicon
floating gate a donor density of 1e18 /cc.  A simple mesh refinement is then
carried out to give better resolution near the p-n junctions, and the structure is
saved
<br/>
In the next section the structure is loaded and the
device with zero floating gate charge is simulated
to give the unprogrammed Id-Vg curves.
<br/>
</p>
<p>
The next section loads the structure and assigns the floating gate to be
a perfect conductor using the
<b> FLOATING </b> parameter on the
<b> CONTACT </b> statement, as well setting the workfunction to be that for n-doped polysilicon
by using the
<b> N.POLY</b> flag.  The floating gate is given a negative charge of
-1e-15 C/cm  using the Q&lt;elec&gt; syntax of the SOLVE statement.  This is
an alternative to charging the floating gate during a transient solve.
The Id-Vg curve of this charged device is then obtained, and the structure
file with a control gate bias of 3 V is saved.
<br/>
The final section loads in the structure and uses the syntax
<br/>
<b> ELECTRODE MODIFY FLOATING </b> <br/>
to specify that the named electrode should be
treated as an isolated semiconductor. It is still necessary to specify the
workfunction of the contact using the N.POLY parameter on the CONTACT statement,
but the FLOATING parameter should not be specified on the CONTACT statement in
this case.   The floating gate is given a negative charge of
-1e-15 C/cm  using the Q&lt;elec&gt; syntax of the SOLVE statement, as previously,
and the Id-Vg curve is obtained. The PROBE statement saves the integrated floating gate
charge to the logfile. The structure file of the device with a
control gate bias of 3V is saved.
<br/>
The visualisation of the structure files shows a cutline through the gate stack,
with the floating electrode case having a position dependent electron concentration
and the floating contact case showing no concentration. The potentials in the
floating gate can also be compared to see an equipotential in the floating contact
case and potential changes in the floating electrode case.  The Id-Vg
curves are slightly different between the two cases,  due to the different charge
distributions.  The integrated total charge of the floating electrode, as obtained
from the PROBE statement, can be seen to be bias independent.  The threshold voltages
for the three curves can be obtained from the results.final file.
