This examples demonstrates steady-state and transient simulation of
an Flash EPROM device in three dimensions.
</p>
<p>
In this example an EPROM device is constructed using DevEdit 3D. The
structure is then passed to Atlas for electrical testing. The input file
consists of the following sections:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of the device in DevEdit 3D
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Threshold voltage test before programming
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Transient simulation of Flash EPROM programming
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Threshold voltage test after programming
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first stage of the input constructs the EPROM geometry, material regions,
doping profiles, and electrodes in DevEdit 3D. The structure was created in
DevEdit 3D by drawing the device regions in interactive mode and specifying 3D
doping distribution. Finally the mesh was generated automatically by specifying
basic mesh constraints and refining in the important areas of the device.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas simulation begins from reading in the structure from
DevEdit 3D.  DeckBuild provides an automatic interface between DevEdit
and Atlas so that the structure produced by DevEdit 3D is transferred
to Atlas without having to use the mesh statement.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas, the
<b> contact </b> statements are used to assign the work function on the polysilicon
gates and to specify the floating gate contact. The
<b> interface </b> statement is used to assign a fixed interface charge under the floating gate.
The
<b> models </b> statement is used to select a set of physical models for programming
simulation.  The  key model for programming is the hot carrier injection model
to give the gate current. This is enabled by
<b> models hei</b> .
</p>
<p>
First the initial solution for zero biases is obtained.  Next, Id/Vgs
calculations are performed with zero charge on the floating gate
(before programming). The drain voltage is set to 0.5V, and the control
gate voltage is ramped until the drain current reaches a compliance
limit set with the &apos;compl&apos; parameter. At this stage the combined algorithm
is specified using
<b> method gummel newton</b> .
It means that if convergence is not reached in decoupled mode (gummel) the
simulator will automatically switch to coupled mode (newton).
</p>
<p>
Next, the programming process is simulated. First of all, the control
gate voltage is ramped to 10V. The combined algorithm is used for this
stage, but the coupled Newton method is used for transient analysis
calculations. In the transient analysis the drain voltage is ramped to
5.5V in 1ns. Vds is kept constant while transient programming is
performed until the time set by
<b>tfinal </b> is reached.
</p>
<p>
The final stage of the file re-simulates the Id/Vgs curve to obtain the
threshold voltage after programming. The results of the two Id/Vgs curves can be overlaid using TonyPlot.
<b> extract </b> statements can be used to measure the threshold according to
user-defined rules. Details of the extract syntax for threshold voltage
can be found under the MOS threshold voltage example. extract can also be used to measure the threshold voltage shift by subtracting the two previously extracted thresholds.
