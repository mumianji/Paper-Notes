In recent years, it has become increasingly important to investigate the effects
of stress in MOS transistors for SoC (System on Chip) design because
stress/strain effects are now used to improve the performance of the
MOS transistors.
Particularly, SoC transistor TEGs have attracted considerable attention in
order to study the effects of stress liner films and the dependence on active
region length, trench width, and gate-pitch.
</p>
<p>
This example demonstrates a stress simulation for a SoC transistor TEG.
The 3D structure is created by about 30 command lines with three mask layers
(GATE, ACTIVE, and CONTACT) using Victory Process. A 3D mesh is created for the
stress calculation.
</p>
<p>
Then the stress distribution is simulated by Victory Stress. First, the result
from Victory Process is loaded. The parameters of the materials such as young modulas,
poisson ratio, and intrinsic stress are set. Then the matrix calculation method
is set, and the stress is calculated. Finally, the structure, stress distribution
and the stress enhanced mobility factors for electrons/holes are saved.
