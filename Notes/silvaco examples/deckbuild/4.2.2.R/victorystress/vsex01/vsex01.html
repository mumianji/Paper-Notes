This example is executed in two steps:
</p>
<p>
First, Victory Process is used to generate the FinFET structure out of specifications provided in a
layout file. The &apos;line x|y|z..&apos; statements are used to refine the mesh inside the FinFET structure
in the area of the gate and the fin. At the end of the Victory Process simulation run the structure
is exported with a tetrahedral volume mesh and is saved to the file
&apos;vsex01_fine_victory_conformal_ex.str&apos; which can be visualized with
<b> Tonyplot3d</b> .
</p>
<p>
In the second part of the simulation deck stress analysis is performed by Victory Stress. The
statement
</p>
<b> go victorystress</b> <p>
starts the Victory Stress simulator. Than, the FinFET structure created in the first part of the
simulation run is loaded with the
<b> Init</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> Material</b> statement defines different elastic properties of the materials contained in the
structure. Without those definitions, Victory Stress would load default values of these properties
from an internal material database. The
<b> Material </b> statement overrides those default values.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> Method</b> statement chooses a particular linear equation system solver for solving the the system of elastic
stress equations. In this case the solver called &apos;ams&apos; is selected.
</p>
<p>
The stress analysis itself is a one-step simulation and it is started by the
<b> Stress </b> statement.
Note : Since it is not specified explictly in this examples, the default crystal orientations are
applied, which means that a (100) silicon wafer is used and the fin is oriented in the &lt;100&gt;
direction.
</p>
<p>
Once stress analysis simulation is complete the three-dimensional structure is saved with the
<b> Save </b> statement and can be visualized using
<b> Tonyplot3d</b> .
