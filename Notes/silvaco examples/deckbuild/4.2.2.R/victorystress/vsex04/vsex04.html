Extremely thin SOI (ETSOI) devices are attractive for low power applications. The integration scheme
of the ETSOI technology allows formation of  raised source/drain (RSD) extensions
for both NFET and PFET by using a single mask. Another feature of ETSOI CMOS is the combination of
two strain enhancement techniques, (1) Si:C RSD for NFET and SiGe RSD for PFET,
and (2) stress liner effect coupled with faceted RSD.
</p>
<p>
Details and features of the ETSOI CMOS can be found in [1], [2]. This example demonstrates stress
simulation for ETSOI CMOS. Geometry parameters are taken from Figs.3 and 4, of Ref. [2].
The nominal gate length for this simulation is 26nm. The stress simulation has been performed for a
half of the device due to its symmetry.
The following geometry parameters can be changed in this simulation in order to investigate
the influence of the device geometry on stress distribution, and, therefore, on device performance:
1) - the gate length; 2) - the gate height; 3) - the RSD height; 4) - the thickness of stress liner;
5) -  the gate oxide thickness; 6) - the thickness of silicon on insulator (SOI);
7) - the thickness of bottom oxide; 8) - proximity of the bottom of RSD to the gate;
9) - proximity of the top of RSD to the gate (in case of faceted RSD);
10) - the width of simulation domain.
Also, the following 5 logical parameters can be used to vary simulation conditions:
</p>
<b> flag_faceted_RSD </b> <p>
specifies that RSD has a slopped edge;
</p>
<b> flag_RSD </b> <p>
specifies that RSD serves as a stressor;
</p>
<b> flag_liner </b> <p>
specifies nitride stressor;
</p>
<b> flag_poly </b> <p>
specifies that poly serves as a stressor;
</p>
<b> mat_RSD </b> <p>
specifies that materials for RSD, mat_RSD=-1 corresponds to SiGe and mat_RSD=1 corresponds to Si:C.
</p>
<p>
All above parameters can be varied  or used in design of experiments. The nominal values of
parameters are set to correspond to conditions presented in Figs. 3 and 4 of [2].
</p>
<p>
The 2D structure is obtain by Victory Process running in 2D mode and is subsequently used in Victory
Stress. The isotropic model for stress simulations is used in this simulation since
the structure is 2D. Thereofre, the elastic properties of Si, SiGe, and  Si:C
are considered to be the same as for polysilicon. All parameters mentioned
above could be changed. Each run of this example produces stress distributions
for three types of stressors: first is for RSD regions either of SiGe with
negative intrinsic stress or of Si:C with positive intrinsic stress; the
second is the stress-liner made of nitride; the third one is the stress
memorized in the gate. As a result of the simulations the four files will be
saved for two geometries of RSD (vertical and faceted) and for all three
stressor types.
</p>
<p>
In case of vertical RSD these four files are: vsex04_0.str
(initial structure), vsex04_2.str (RSD-stressor), vsex04_4.str
(stress-liner), and vsex04_6.str (poly gate stressor).
</p>
<p>
In case of faceted RSD these four files are: vsex04_1.str
(initial structure), vsex04_3.str (RSD-stressor), vsex04_5.str
(stress-liner), and vsex04_7.str (poly gate stressor).
