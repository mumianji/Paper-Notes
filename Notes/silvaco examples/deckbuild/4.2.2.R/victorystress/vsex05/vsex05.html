Extremely thin SOI (ETSOI) devices are attractive for low power applications. The integration scheme
of the ETSOI technology allows formation of  raised source/drain (RSD) extensions
for both NFET and PFET by using a single mask. Another feature of ETSOI CMOS is the combination of
two strain enhancement techniques, (1) Si:C RSD for NFET and SiGe RSD for PFET,
and (2) stress liner effect coupled with faceted RSD.
</p>
<p>
Details and features of the ETSOI CMOS can be found in [1], [2]. Please refer to vsex04.in
for a comprehensive description of the stress simulation.
</p>
<p>
The 2D structure is created in Athena and subsequently used in Victory Stress. In this
example we compare, IV characteristics obtained using Atlas, with stress-liner made
of nitride with two geometries of RSD (vertical and faceted).
</p>
<p>
Aside from the standard silicon models (cvt, srh, etc), we used the strain
dependent mobility enhancement models
<b> nhance </b> and
<b> phance </b> defined in the
<b> mobility </b> statement  for this simulation. The mobility enhancement models apply the second
order mobility enhancement tensor (calculated by Victory Stress) directly to the
low field mobility. This results in directionally dependent (anisotropic) electron
and hole mobilities. For the model to take effect the enhancement factors
must be included in the structure file simulated by Victory Stress. This is done by
setting
<b> nhance </b> and
<b> phance </b> defined in the
<b> mobility </b> statement of Victory Stress.
</p>
<p>
Electrical simulations show that the effect of stress/strain results in drive
current increase and as shown in [2] higher increase with faceted RSD.
