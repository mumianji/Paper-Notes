In modern semiconductor devices, the effects of physical lattice strain are
playing an increasingly important role. One reason for this is that as device
dimensions have shrunk, strains due to lattice mismatch or differences in
thermal expansion have become more prevalent. Another is that strain has
become an important tool in modifying and enhancing the electrical properties
of the semiconductor materials. Large strain induced gains in both electron
and hole mobilities have been reported.

<p>
This example demonstrates how SILVACO tools can be used to simulate the
creation of a 3D FinFET using Victory Process, calculate the internal strains
using Victory Stress, and analyze its electrical characteristics using
Victory Device.
</p>
<p>
Victory Process was used to generate the FinFET structure based on specifications
provided in a mask layout file using the
<b> Layout </b> statement.
Victory Process was used to build up a FinFET structure with a 50x50 nm fin, 1um
in length. The fin was deposited on a SiO2 substrate layer and a 2 nm gate
isolation layer separated it from the 50 nm polysilicon gate crossing it
at right angles. A 100 nm Si3N4 capping layer was deposited on top of the
structure.
</p>
<p>
The structure created by Victory Process was imported into Victory Stress, which
was used to perform a stress analysis over the whole FinFET device structure.
The Si3N4 capping layer was set to have uniform hydrostatic tensile stress of
1 GPa using the statement
<b> material nitride intrin.sig=1e10 </b> The evaluation of mobility enhancement factors along the fin is based on a full
3D piezoresistive model.
</p>
<p>
The structure, along with the stress/strain and mobility enhancement data, was
then loaded into Victory Device for electrical simulation and analysis. Source
and drain electrodes were defined at either end of the Silicon fin, the Polysilicon
region was defined to be the gate, and we put a substrate contact at the bottom
of the device. We also set the workfunction of the gate to 4.17 eV.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the standard silicon models (cvt, consrh, etc), we used the strain
dependent mobility enhancement models
<b> nhance </b> and
<b> phance </b> defined in the
<b> mobility </b> statement for this simulation. The mobility enhancement models apply the second
order mobility enhancement tensor (calculated by Victory Stress) directly to the
low field mobility. This results in directionally dependent (anisotropic) electron
and hole mobilities.
</p>
<p>
Electrical simulations show that the effect of stress/strain results in drive
current increase as expected.
