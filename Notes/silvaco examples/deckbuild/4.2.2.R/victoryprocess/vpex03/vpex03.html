The goal of this example is to provide a tutorial on Victory Process cell mode
based on a 3D buffered super junction LDMOS device. The device simulation itself
and corresponding description can be found in powerex18 example. A Detailed description
of the process syntax is mentioned in the text below as well as in the input deck itself.
</p>
<b> Super junctions</b> <p>
are used in LDMOS structures to
<b> greatly increase the breakdown voltage</b> of small geometry devices
by allowing the drain depletion region to spread in two dimensions
instead of one at higher drain voltages
(the additional direction being laterally across the super junction).
The neat result is that the drain voltage can now be spread across
a much greater total distance than would otherwise be the case,
which greatly lowers the field at the drain
and therefore increases the breakdown voltage.

By default Victory Process runs on just one processor.
To ensure better performance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot;</b> could be specified in the
<b> go</b> line starting Victory Process. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
Victory Process in cell mode starts with a definition of the initial wafer material, including its thickness
<b> depth=10</b> and background doping
<b> dopant=boron dopingvalue=1e15</b> , as well as the simulation domain. The horizontal extent of the simulation domain is automatically determined from the enclosing bounding box of the mask layers contained in the mask file
<b> vpex03.lay</b> . This mask file is imported into Victory Process with the
<b> layout</b> parameter. The
<b> depth=10</b> and
<b> gasheight=5</b> parameters set the vertical extent of the simulation domain as follows: the vertical position of the wafer surface is at &quot;0&quot; level on the Z-axis with the wafer of
<b> 10 um</b> in thickness along the positive Z-direction. Above the wafer surface in the negative Z-direction lies a &apos;transparent&apos; gas region with a thickness of
<b> 5 um</b> .
</p>
<p>
After the wafer initialization, we manually define the volume data mesh by several
<b> line</b> statements. These mesh lines are especially intended for subsequent implantation and diffusion steps. Then, we implant boron
and phosphorus ions into regions that are supposed to be p-base and n-buffer regions with the aid of &quot;PBASE&quot; and &quot;NBUFF&quot; mask
layers and after that perform a diffusion process. The next step consists of defining a poly gate with &quot;POLY&quot; mask and forming
n-pillar, p-pillar, n+ source/drain and p+ regions with &quot;NILLAR&quot;, &quot;PILLAR&quot;, &quot;NSD&quot;, and &quot;PPLUS&quot; layers, respectively, by ion
implantation and thermal diffusion.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we make contact holes in the oxide layer and fill them with aluminum to form the source, drain, and substrate electrodes. The statement
<b> electrodes &quot;cont&quot; aluminum</b> turns all exposed aluminum regions that are overlapped with &quot;cont&quot; layer into electrodes and assigns corresponding labels from &quot;cont&quot; layer as electrode names to those electrodes. Similarly, with the statement
<b> electrodes &quot;cont&quot; polysilicon</b> all exposed polysilicon regions that are overlapped with &quot;cont&quot; layer become electrodes taking corresponding labels from &quot;cont&quot; layer as their names.
</p>
<p>
Victory Process in cell mode provides several options to export calculated process structure to a format suitable for device simulation. These include, e.g.,:
</p>
<b> export 2d y=2:</b> <p>
Export a 2D cross-section of the geometry and the volume data across a plane parallel to one of the coordinate planes (Y=2).
</p>
<b> export atlas3d(regular):</b> <p>
Export a prismatic mesh that contains all nodes of the volume data mesh and an approximated representation of the geometry of the process mesh.
</p>
<b> export victory(delaunay):</b> <p>
Export an unstructured tetrahedral mesh with local mesh density controllable by users.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Victory Process in cell mode supports mirroring feature for all options of prismatic mesh export, e.g.,
<b> export atlas3d(conformal) mirror=&quot;-x+y&quot; </b> ,
<b> export atlas3d(regular) mirror=&quot;x-y&quot;</b> ,
<b> export atlas3d(reduced) mirror=&quot;-x-y&quot; </b> and enables cropping the structure with mask layers, e.g., &quot;CRP&quot; layer, within an unstructured tetrahedral mesh export
<b> export victory(delaunay) crop.mask=&quot;CRP&quot; </b> </p>
