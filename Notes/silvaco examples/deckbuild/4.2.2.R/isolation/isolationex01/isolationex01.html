This example simulates punchthrough between two n+ areas separated by
an oxide isolation structure. The isolation structure is a local
oxidation using Sealed Interface Local Oxidation (SILO) combined with
a p-type field stop implant.
</p>
<p>
This example demonstrates the following features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Processing of a local oxidation structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Remeshing at the process to device simulation interface
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Remeshing within device simulation
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Ramping iv curves to a compliance limit
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This example starts with process simulation using Athena, remeshes
using DEVEDIT, and interfaces to Atlas. Atlas ramps the voltage up to a predefined
drain current value,
a further remesh in DEVEDIT is performed, and Atlas ramps to the
punchthrough target current.
</p>
<p>
For details on local oxidation (bird&apos;s beak) process simulations, see the
ATHENA_SSUPREM4 examples section.
</p>
<p>
The electrodes are placed at the end of the process flow and then
subsequently named with
<b> electrode </b> statements. Only the
<b> x </b> coordinate needs to be specified in this case as the electrodes are on the surface of the structure. Should they be buried, both
<b> x </b> and
<b> y </b> coordinates need to be specified. Both polysilicon and metal regions are treated as
possible electrodes.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> electrode name=substrate backside </b> statement will automatically place an electrode on the bottom of
the structure. This is the best and most efficient way of approximating a well contact.
</p>
<p>
After the process simulation, the structure is remeshed with DEVEDIT
with the command:
<b> go devedit </b> </p>
<p>
At this point the solution only contains solution quantities from the
process simulator, so that only impurity values are available as
remeshing criteria. These are selected with the commands:
</p>
<br/>
<b> imp.refine imp=&quot;Arsenic&quot; sensitivity=0.5 </b> <br/>
<b> imp.refine imp=&quot;Boron&quot; sensitivity=0.4 </b> <br/>
<b> imp.refine imp=&quot;Phosphorus&quot; sensitivity=0.5 </b> <p>
Boron is weighted so that the mesh will be more sensitive to boron
concentration gradients. In other words, the smaller the value for
<b> sensitivity, </b> the more sensitive the mesh will be to concentration gradients and the
denser the mesh will be.
</p>
<p>
In this example,
<b> constr.mesh </b> commands control the maximum allowable angle within a
triangle, specific to a material type. For example:
<br/>
<b> constr.mesh type=Insulator default max.angle=178 </b> <br/>
states that very obtuse triangles are allowed in all insulator (oxide)
regions.
</p>
<p>
This is acceptable, as obtuse triangles are essentially only a problem
in semiconductor regions when solving carrier transport equations.
The reason for doing this is because by lowering the criteria for
maintaining zero obtuse triangles, the more relaxed the mesh can be
and  the simulation will run faster.
</p>
<p>
Next the structure is passed into the device simulator Atlas for
biasing and design parameter extraction. This is accomplished with
the command
<b> go atlas. </b> </p>
<p>
As the device is simply punching though, the current is governed almost
completely by the potential barrier and drain induced barrier lowering
effects. Thus a special mobility model is not selected to speed up the calculation.
</p>
<p>
An interface charge of 1e11 is selected arbitrarily, and may be adjusted
as a primary calibration parameter to match experimental results.
</p>
<p>
A sequence of
<b> solve </b> commands ramps the drain contact up to 30V using a current
compliance of 0.001uA. The simulation stops when either of these is
exceeded. In the present example, this will be at
about 14V drain voltage. It is assumed that the breakdown will not
occur during this ramp.
For the last bias point, a single structure file,
containing both the mesh and the solution, is saved.
</p>
<p>
After the previous biasing of about 14 volts, the structure is remeshed
again using
DEVEDIT
this time as a function of potential gradient, doping
gradient and electron concentration gradient resulting in a more accurate
mesh. The current compliance value has been chosen such that the
resulting drain voltage has a value that will always be lower than
the punchthrough voltage, but is high enough to offer a closer solution
to the final IV area of interest.
</p>
<p>
Another log file is opened for the final punchthrough IV curve to be held.
The solution is reloaded with the new mesh created by DEVEDIT
and the drain bias is increased up to 30 volts or 0.1um/W/L, whichever is reached
sooner.
</p>
<p>
Finally, a design parameter relating to the punchthrough voltage is extracted.
</p>
<p>
The command
<br/>
<b>extract name=&quot;n_isolation_vpt&quot; x.val from curve(abs(v.&quot;drain&quot;),abs(i.&quot;drain&quot;)) where y.val = 1.0e-7</b> <br/>
should be allowed to run over two lines. Do not use a line continuation character
in any
<b> extract </b> statement.  It defines the measure of punchthrough as that drain voltage at which the drain current is 0.1uA/um.
