This examples demonstrates punchthrough between unrelated n+ regions
separated by trench isolation. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Trench formation by ELITE physical etch models
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Trench doping using SSUPREM4 implant models
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Trench fill by ELITE physical deposition models
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Punchthrough test across the trench using Atlas
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The example file consists of two parts. The first uses Athena to
construct the geometry and doping of two n+ areas separated by trench
isolation. The second uses Atlas to simulate punchthrough between these
two regions.
</p>
<p>
Details of ELITE and SSUPREM4 syntax for trench formation and refill
can be found in the appropriate Athena example sections.
</p>
<p>
The trench is formed by Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), with different
isotropic and anisotropic etch rates for each material present.  A
field implant is performed directly into the trench.
</p>
<p>
The device is interfaced automatically into Atlas. The two carrier mode is
selected along with impact ionisation. The contact named drain is
ramped to 20 volts under the control of a current compliance limit of 3e-12 A/um.
</p>
<p>
The final drain current contours are plotted at the end of the
simulation, where the current density can be seen to avoid the field
implant doping peak.
</p>
<p>
A design parameter is measured at the end of the Atlas simulation using the
<b> extract </b> statement. The parameter is defined as the voltage required on the
drain to get 2e-12 A/um of drain current.
