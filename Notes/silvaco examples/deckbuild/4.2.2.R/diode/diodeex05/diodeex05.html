This example demonstrates  electrical
simulation of a Zener diode breakdown. It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 The formation of a 2D Zener diode structure in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 The transfer of the structure to Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of models for Zener breakdown simulation
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Reverse bias simulation to the breakdown voltage
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The structure formation is performed by implanting a heavy boron dose into a
heavily doped n-type substrate. The 2D extent of the p+ region is controlled
by the etch coordinate of an oxide mask. A short diffusion is performed
in Athena to drive in the p+ dopant.
</p>
<p>
After the diffusion,
<b> extract </b> statements are used to measure the
junction depth and sheet resistance of the p+ region. After this, metal
is added and patterned. The electrode positions are then defined using
the
<b> electrode </b> statements in Athena.
</p>
<p>
The statement
<b> go atlas </b> enables the automatic interface from Athena to Atlas.
DeckBuild will switch simulators to Atlas and load in the final Athena structure
as the initial Atlas mesh.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas, the first lines of syntax define the models to be used in the
simulation. The statement
<b> models bip </b> defines the standard bipolar model set
that is also recommended for diode simulation. This consists of
concentration, temperature and electric field dependent mobilities,
concentration dependent SRH and Auger recombination, and band gap
narrowing. The parameter
<b> bbt.std </b> enables the Lombardi band-to-band
tunneling model. In heavily doped diodes this mechanism is the
principal leakage current mechanism at voltages less than the avalanche
breakdown.  The
<b> impact </b> statement enables the impact ionization model of
Selberherr.
</p>
<p>
Newton&apos;s method is chosen on the method statement. The parameter
<b> climit=1e-4 </b> is highly recommended for all reverse bias simulations
in Atlas. It enables higher accuracy in the calculation of carrier
concentration in the depletion regions.
</p>
<p>
The anode voltage is then ramped up to -10V in 0.25V steps. The
breakdown voltage of this device is around -5.5V. Atlas will converge
up to this voltage and then stop as no solutions beyond this voltage
are possible. By plotting the output log file in TonyPlot, the breakdown
can clearly be seen. The pre-breakdown current is dominated by
band-to-band tunneling. An equivalent simulation excluding the &apos;bbt.std&apos;
parameter might be run to demonstrate this.
</p>
<p>
The final statements use the
<b> extract </b> feature of DeckBuild to measure
the maximum anode voltage at which convergence was obtained and the
anode voltage for a particular value of anode current.
