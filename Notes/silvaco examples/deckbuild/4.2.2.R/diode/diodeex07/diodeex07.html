This example shows the transient oscillatory behavior of a
<b> Gunn </b> device due to
the negative differential resistance of behavior exhibited by GaAs
(as a result of electron intervalley transfer).
</p>
<p>
In the first part of the input file the structure is defined within DevEdit.
The device is a sandwich structure made up of 2 gold electrode layers on the
top and bottom, one low doped transit layer in the middle and 2 high doped
layers acting as low resistivity contact regions and carrier injectors.
</p>
<p>
The thickness of the transit layer together with the applied electric field
is one of the key design features determining the frequency of the oscillations.
</p>
<p>
In the second part of the file, after the &apos;go atlas&apos; statement, transient device
simulations are performed for different biases.
</p>
<p>
After loading the structure from DevEdit, a load resistor is attached at
the anode side with the
<b> contact </b> statement. In order to model the negative differential velocity saturation
behavior for electrons,
<b> fldmob </b> in the model statement is
specified together with the
<b> evsatmod=1 </b> parameter.  This switches on the negative differential mobility model
for GaAs like materials. As the function of holes is negligable, the
solution of the hole continuity equation can be disabled by specifying
<b> carriers=1.</b> </p>
<p>
By ramping up the bias of the anode to 2 V one can clearly see the effect of
the negative resistance
<b> extract </b> is used to calculate the critical electric field from the log-file. With the
following stationary simulation it can be shown that the bias is not sufficient
to feed an oscillation with the given load, the oscillation is damped. The
frequency is calculated by extracting the time required of 4 full periods.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the device is able to operate at 4V bias. To monitor the movement
of the domains, select several of the different electron distributions
from different points in time (as 2d contours or the corresponding cutlines)
displayed with TonyPlot at the end of the simulation, and make a movie using
the
<b> Tools: Movie </b> menu.
