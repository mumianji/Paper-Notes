This example demonstrates the correct method for global temperature ramping in
<b> Atlas </b> for any device.  A diode structure was chosen here for simplicity.
In Atlas the
<b> global temperature </b> of the device is set using the
<b> models </b> statement.  However, the global temperature can only be set ONCE in the input
deck if ALL the temperature dependent parameters are to be set.  If the
temperature is reset during a single input deck with a second &quot;models
statement&quot; an incorrect result is obtained, since not all of the temperature
dependent parameters are set in subsequent models statements.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to use the combination of a &quot;go atlas&quot; statement, together with
a &quot;mesh infile=&quot; statement.  After the mesh statement, reset the global
temperature with a new &quot;models&quot; statement.
</p>
<p>
The device bias conditions can then either be ramped up from zero, as in this
example, or loaded in from the previous solution with a
<b> &quot;load infile=&quot; </b> statement.  In order to end up with one continuous
<b> log outfile </b> the keyword
<b> append </b> must be added to the log outfile name after the second and subsequent &quot;log
outfile=&quot; statements in order to prevent the original log file from being
overwritten.
</p>
<p>
This example also plots the electron and hole
<b> mobility versus temperature</b> . Substituting different mobility models allows the temperature effects of each
to be compared.
