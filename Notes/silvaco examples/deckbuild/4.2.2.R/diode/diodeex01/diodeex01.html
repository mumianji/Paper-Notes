This example demonstrates simulation of a Schottky Diode Forward Characteristic.
It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Formation of a diode structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting of Schottky barrier height for the anode
<br/>
   </li>
  <li>
 Forward biasing the anode
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In the first part of the input file the device is described, including
mesh, electrodes locations, and doping distribution. This is a 2D
n-type device with heavily doped floating p-type guard ring regions,
located at the left and right sides of the structure. The Schottky
anode is located at the top of the device, and a heavily doped cathode is located at
the bottom of the device.
</p>
<p>
After the device description, the
<b> model </b> statement is used to specify the following set of models :
carrier concentration dependent mobility
<b> (ccsmob)</b> , field dependent mobility, band-gap narrowing,
SRH and Auger recombination. The two carrier model is specified here as well (carriers=2).
</p>
<p>
The key statement for setting a Schottky contact is
<b> contact name=&lt;char&gt; work=&lt;val&gt;</b> . It is used to specify the workfunction of the Schottky electrode. In this
example, since the substrate is n-type silicon with an affinity of 4.17,
the specified workfunction of 4.97 provides
a Schottky-barrier height of 0.8V. The default barrier height is zero
(a perfect ohmic contact). This condition is assumed for the cathode.
</p>
<p>
The electrical simulation simply ramps the anode voltage to 1.0V in
0.05V steps using the
<b> solve </b> statement. The results of the simulation are then displayed using TonyPlot.
