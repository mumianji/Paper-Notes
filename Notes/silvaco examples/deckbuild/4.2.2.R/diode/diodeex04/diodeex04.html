In this example, a SiC diode is simulated to demonstrate the Atlas
capabilities to handle wide band gap semiconductor devices under room and
elevated temperature conditions. The interest toward SiC technologies
is growing due to the thermal and electronic properties of the material
potentially leading to very high figures of merit for high-power,
high-speed, high-temperature, and radiation hard applications.
</p>
<p>
The p+/n/n+ diode structure considered is a device based on one of the SiC
polytypes called alpha-SiC (or 6H-SiC), and is constructed using Atlas syntax.
The input file consists of the following main parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Mesh, regions, electrodes and doping specification using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Material and models definition for SiC
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calculation of forward I-V characteristic under the room temperature conditions
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calculation of forward I-V characteristics under elevated temperature 623K
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calculation of reverse and breakdown characteristics at 623K
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The simulations at elevated temperatures are performed in  a separate Atlas run within the same input file with the respective resetting/changing of the material and models
definition.
</p>
<p>
The input file starts by defining the mesh. The location and grid spacing
along x and y directions are specified in the
<b> x.m </b> and
<b> y.m </b> statements. This
simulation employs cylindrical symmetry and is therefore quasi-3-dimensional.
To activate this feature, the parameter
<b> cylindrical </b> is included in the
<b> mesh</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The structure consists of 3 regions: p+ emitter, n base, and n+ emitter
regions, each uniformly doped. The dimensions of the regions and their
doping are defined in the
<b> region </b> and
<b> doping </b> statements respectively.
The anode and cathode contacts are specified in the
<b> electrode </b> statements.
</p>
<p>
Basic material parameters of alpha-SiC are defined in the
<b> material </b> statements.
These include dielectric permittivity, energy band gap, parameters related to
the band gap narrowing, auger recombination coefficients, saturation velocity,
and parameters describing mobility and lifetime temperature dependencies. The
low field mobilities and lifetimes are specified on a region-by-region basis
taking into consideration the level of doping in the respective regions.
</p>
<p>
The set of physical models in the
<b> model </b> statement includes electric field
mobility dependence, Shockley-Read-Hall and Auger recombination, and band gap
narrowing. The temperature is also specified in the model statement.
</p>
<p>
The first run is completed by the
<b> solve </b> statement in which the anode bias is
stepped from 0.1 up to 4 V to calculate the diode forward characteristic
under room temperature conditions. The I-V data is saved in the log file.
</p>
<p>
The second Atlas run simulates the forward, reverse, and breakdown
characteristics under elevated temperature conditions. It starts by
reading in the mesh and structure data from the file produced by the first run.
In order to use the same cylindrical symmetry as the first run the
<b> cylindrical </b> parameter must be specified whilst loading the mesh.  The
same material and model statements are used in this input file with the
temperature set at 623K. Then the solving procedure is repeated to
obtain the forward I-V characteristic which is saved in the log file.
</p>
<p>
The set of physical models needs to be extended for simulating reverse
and breakdown characteristics to include the impact
ionization-generation model.  This is done in the following part of the
input file, in the
<b> impact </b> statement.  The Selberherr impact
ionization model is used with the parameters changed to reflect the
properties of alpha-SiC. The other material and model statements are
repeated here to ensure proper reinitialization of the material and
models parameters. Since the breakdown in diode structures is typically
very sharp  the
<b> curvetrace </b> feature of Atlas is used to bias the curve. Note that the parameter
<b> step.init </b> is negative. This is sufficient to force a negative voltage sweep on
the anode.  The reverse/breakdown characteristic is saved in the log
file. To plot the breakdown the
<b> anode int.bias </b> should be used as the x-axis.
</p>
<p>
The graphs with the forward I-V characteristics at the room and elevated
temperatures, and the reverse and breakdown characteristic at 623K are
displayed using TonyPlot.
</p>
<p>
Since cylindrical coordinates were used, Note that in all I-V plots the
units of current is Amps and not Amps/micron.
