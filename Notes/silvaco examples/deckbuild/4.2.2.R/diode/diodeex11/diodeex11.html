This example shows how to include ionic species in the insulator of a MOS-C capacitor.
The mobile species affect the small signal conductance and capacitance of the device
as a function of bias and frequency.  The deck builds a basic MOS-C structure using
Atlas commands.  Then an ionic species is added using the DOPING statement.
<br/>
<b> doping region=1 species1 gaussian conc=1e16 char=0.06 lat.char=0.15  peak=0.125</b> <br/>
with the SPECIES1 parameter.  Another species is initialised using the same syntax, and
both species have an initial gaussian distribution.  The PROBE statement is used to
set up an integration of the species over the device. The generic ion transport model is
selected on the MODELS statement
<br/>
<b> models srh nspecies=2 species1.z=2 species2.z=-1</b> <br/>
where NSPECIES=2 indicates there are two species, and SPECIES1.Z=2 indicates that the first
has a double positive charge and SPECIES2.Z=-1 indicates that the second has a single negative
charge. The METHOD statement
<br/>
<b> method species.maxx=1.0e6 species.ins</b> <br/>
 restricts the species to the insulator and sets the maximum permissible update vector to be
a ratio of 1.0e6.

The anode is biased to 1.0 V and the anode voltage is ramped to -2.0 V with the small signal
parameters calculated at 100 Hz. This is then repeated with the small signal frequency being
1 GHz. These curves are compared to the MOS-C without ions in the insulator.  In the latter
case the Capacitance varies only slightly with the channel charge.  With ionic species present,
and at 100 Hz, the movement of ionic charge by the test signal gives a large capacitance. At
an anode voltage of 1 V the negative ions are near the anode and the positive ions are near
the semiconductor/insulator interface.  As the anode bias changes to -2 V,  this situation
reverses and when the centre of charge is near the centre of the insulator the small signal
capacitance is a maximum.  With a test signal of 1 GHz the ionic species are not sufficently
mobile to react and so the small signal capacitance is much reduced.  The species density
profiles are shown in the cutline of the plot of the structure file at 1.o and -2.0 V anode bias.
The PROBE statements can optionally  be selected in the first plot and show that the integrated density of each species is
constant (because there are no reactions and the species are confined to the insulator).
They also show the species concentration at the center of the insulating layer as a function of bias.
