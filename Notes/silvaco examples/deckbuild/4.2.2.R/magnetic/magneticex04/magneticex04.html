<p>
The Hall scattering factors, r_n and r_p, are theoretical constants
which is put into MAGNETIC2D and affects the terms of the Magnetic
matrix. For the limit n &gt;&gt; p we have a theoretical Hall coefficient
of -r_n/n e and for p &gt;&gt; n we have a theoretical Hall coefficient of
r_p/p e.  The Hall coefficients can also be calculated directly from
the simulated  Hall voltage, current density and magnetic field as
explained in the Atlas manual.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this deck is to obtain the Hall coefficients directly
from the simulation results, and multiply by the relevant carrier
density to extract values for the hall scattering factors over a range of
biases.  These are then plotted to show that they agree closely with the
values of Hall-scattering factor input on the MODELS statement.  This acts
as one validation of the Magnetic module.

Note: You should select anode bias as the
X-quantity in the plot of the extracted data.
