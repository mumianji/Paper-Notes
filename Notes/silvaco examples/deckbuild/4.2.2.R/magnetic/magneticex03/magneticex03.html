The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 3D structure formation using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Model settings for 3D Magnetic field
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Field detection using open circuited contacts
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The Magnetic field in Atlas 3D is specified by setting some combination of
BX,BY, or BZ on the MODELS statement. In this case the current flow is in the x-direction and so we set up a field in the y-direction and z-directions
by setting BY and BZ on the
<b> models</b> statement.  Open circuited contacts
are placed perpendicular to the y-direction and z-direction respectively. The
potential drop in the y-direction (and hence
<b> BZ</b> ) is measured between contacts Hall1 and Hall2
and that in the z-direction (and hence
<b> BY</b> ) is measured between contacts Hall3 and Hall4. The ratio of potential
differences generated can be seen to be in proportion to the ratio of
magnetic field components,  thus giving the direction of the field in
the y-z plane.
