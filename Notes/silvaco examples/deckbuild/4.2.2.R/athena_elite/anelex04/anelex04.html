This example demonstrates simple trench etching using a combination
of isotropic and directional etch components. The initial structure
was created in three steps. The
<b> INITIALIZE </b> statement defines
silicon as the substrate material and specifies the structure dimensions.
The second step is a simple vertical deposition. The third step models
lithography in a very simple manner. An opening with critical dimensions
of 0.8 um and sidewall a slope of 89 degrees is created with the
<b> ETCH </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The RIE was performed in two steps. The first step has a high
isotropic component.  This produces a
rounded profile with undercutting. The second portion has a high
directional component.
This produces a quick and dirty simulation
of a strawberry shaped profile that is observed experimentally.
