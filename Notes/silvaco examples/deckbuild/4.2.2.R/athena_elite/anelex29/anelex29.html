This example demonstrates the use of plasma etching to etch a simple
trench structure.
</p>
<p>
The example etch machine uses a Monte Carlo simulated plasma model to
describe the angular ion distribution incident on the substrate surface.
At each point on the surface, an angular &quot;window&quot; of visibility is
calculated.  This window of visibility is used in the integration of
the angular distribution to calculate the etch rate.
</p>
<p>
Each surface string is then moved and remeshed at the end of the
etch step. This windowing, ray tracing technique is highlighted in this
example if you change the SPR500 resist thickness.
</p>
<p>
After trench etch, the structure is implanted at an angle and the
trench is oxidized. This highlights the ability of Elite to perform
physical etch alongside oxidation and implant functions.
</p>
<p>
In the first
<b> rate.etch </b> command, the parameters for the plasma etcher are defined.  These
parameters define the characteristics of the machine and are used to
calculate the ion angular and energy distributions which, in turn, are
used to calculate the ion flux at each point on the surface during
etching.
</p>
<p>
The first parameter,
<b> plasma </b> is used to select the plasma etching model.
</p>
<p>
The parameters for the Monte Carlo plasma etching simulation are
<b> pressure </b> in mT which will effect the mean free path and
therefore the fractional angular window &quot;seen&quot; by the plasma
by a given surface string element.
</p>
<b> tgas </b> <p>
is the gas temperature in Kelvin and and will effect the
pressure and hence the mean free path calculation.
</p>
<b> tion </b> <p>
is the temperature of the ion and is typically at a higher value
than that of the gas.
</p>
<b> vpdc </b> <p>
is the specified DC bias on the cathode electrode. This will
control the energy and angular anisotropy of the incoming ions energy.
</p>
<b> vpac </b> <p>
is the AC component of the electrodes bias.
</p>
<b> lshdc </b> <p>
in meters is the mean debye sheath thickness.
</p>
<b> lshac </b> <p>
is the alternating component of the sheath thickness in meters.
</p>
<b> freq </b> <p>
is the AC frequency of the RF power supply in MegaHertz.
</p>
<b> nparticles </b> <p>
is the number of Monte Carlo particles used in the calculation.
</p>
<b> mgas </b> <p>
is the gas atomic mass in AMUs. This is used in the collision calculation
and will affect the momentum transfer characteristics.
</p>
<b> mion </b> <p>
is the atomic mass of the ion in AMUs.
</p>
<b> elec.model </b> <p>
selects the type of plasma electric field model to be used. Here
there are four options,
</p>
<b> constant, linear, collision, child</b> <p>
. These four models respectively include Constant, Linear electric field
models and then Collision dominated and collisionless Child-Langmuir
models for the spatial dependence of the electric field.
</p>
<b> energy.div </b> <p>
relates to the number of energy divisions for the energy distribution.
</p>
<b> angle.div </b> <p>
relates the the number of angular quantizations for the angular energy
distribution.
</p>
<b> qio </b> <p>
is the momentum transfer cross section in meters^2.
</p>
<b> qcht </b> <p>
is the charge exchange cross section in meters^2.
</p>
<p>
Subsequent
<b> rate.etch </b> statements define the parameters for each of the materials etched.
</p>
<p>
When the plasma model is invoked, the angular window calculation is very
important to the final profile. The Thickness of the photoresist, in this
example, will determine largely the angular ion energy distribution via a
resist
shadowing calculation. Thus, making the resist thicker will result in less
&apos;bowing&apos; of the sidewall. Try making the resist thinner to say, 0.1 um to
see this effect.
