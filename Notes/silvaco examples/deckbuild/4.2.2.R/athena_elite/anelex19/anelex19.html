This example shows the use of
<b> Elite </b> to model a contact opening by using an
isotropic etch followed by a directional etch. This results in an opening
that has edges that may be prone to metal thinning during interconnect metal
deposition.  To reduce this effect, reflow is performed using the
<b> Elite </b> reflow model.  This is accomplished by specifying
</p>
<b> material oxide visc.0=1.862e-20 gamma.reflo=1e3 reflow </b> <b> method viscous </b> <b> diff time=10 temp=950 reflow </b> <p>
which invokes a time temperature cycle that calculates the effects of surface
tension on the structure.
</p>
<p>
Following reflow, the metalization is performed using a simple
CVD model that is characterized using deposit rate and step coverage
parameters.
