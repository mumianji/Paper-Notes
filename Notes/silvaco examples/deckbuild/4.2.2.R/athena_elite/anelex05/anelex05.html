The angular distributions obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation
may be approximated by a Gaussian distribution overlaid by a strong
peak at 0 degrees. Using such an approximation or using the original
distribution obtained from the Monte-Carlo program for the calculation
of local ion flux results in strawberry-shaped profiles.
They have rounded bottoms and a barrel-like underetching in the upper
part of the trenches. A microloading or proximity effect can be seen.
Small feature sizes have a lesser etch rate than wide feature sizes.
The maximum etch rate can only be reached in a distance from the mask
feature that is large compared to the etch depth.
