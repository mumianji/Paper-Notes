This example demonstrates basic capabilities of the Monte Carlo Plasma Etching Module. It shows the effect of polymer redeposition on the etching of a deep trench in silicon.
</p>
<p>
Oxide is used as a masking material. First, a 0.4 micron opening is formed in masking oxide. Than, parameters of plasma for machine MCETCH are specified.
Also, parameters of interaction of incoming ion fluxes as well as polymer
flux with all materials in the structure including polymer are specified
in the
<b> ETCH.RATE </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
After that, 3 minutes of etching is applied to the initial structure with and without
redeposition taken into account. Redeposition is controlled by the
<b> MC.REDEPO </b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
The resulting plot compares the shape of the trenches obtained with and without
redeposition taken into account. It can be seen that redeposition slows down the etching process. Also, the resulting trench has positive slopes instead of a &quot;barrel&quot; shape.
