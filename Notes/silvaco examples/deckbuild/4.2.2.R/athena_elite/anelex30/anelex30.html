This example demonstrates the used of dopant enhanced etching using the Elite
module of Athena.  A simple trench is etched into the silicon substrate
with half of the region of the trench passing through high concentration
Phosphorus.  A normal etch is first performed giving a symmetrical
trench structure.  The simulation is then re-initialized to the pre-etch
state and Phosphorus enhanced etching is defined for the etch machine.
The trench is etched again, but this time the final trench structure is
asymmetrical as the etch rates were enhanced as the surface moved through
the high concentration Phosphorus region.
</p>
<p>
The dopant enhanced etch rate is defined by the equation
</p>
<p>
ERenh = (1 + enh) ER
</p>
<p>
where ER is the normal (un-enhanced) etch rate and enh is the
enhancement due to the dopant.  This enhancement is calculated as a
function of the dopant using the equation:
</p>
<p>
enh = 0.5*Enh.Max*(tanh(Enh.Scale*(S - Enh.MinC)) + 1)
</p>
<p>
where the parameters have the following meanings
</p>
<b> Enh.Max </b> <p>
defines the maximum enhancement factor
</p>
<b> Enh.MinC </b> <p>
gives the solution value below which enhancement decays
</p>
<p>
and
<b> Enh.Scale </b> gives the spread of the enhancement over solution values, i.e., how
quickly does the enhancement factor reach its maximum.
</p>
<p>
For exponentially varying solutions, S and Enh.MinC are used as a logarithm.
