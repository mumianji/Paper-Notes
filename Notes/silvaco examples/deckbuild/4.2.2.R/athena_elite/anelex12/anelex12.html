The example described in this section originated from studies accompanying
the development of a lift-off resist profile for sub-micron MESFET
fabrication using a tri-level resist technique. The goal of this process
development is to get the lift-off profile in the bottom resist of
the tri-level system without using special e-beam exposure techniques
or multi-layer e-beam resists.
</p>
<p>
The resist system used instead is quite simple. The bottom layer
is a hard baked standard Novolac or polyimide resist covered with a
silicon nitride intermediate layer. This intermediate layer is used
during the etching process as a hard mask. The top layer is a PMMA
resist structured by conventional electron beam lithography. The top
PMMA resist is stripped and etching begun.
