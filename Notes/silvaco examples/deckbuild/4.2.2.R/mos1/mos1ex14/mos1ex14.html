This is an Athena/DevEdit/Atlas interface example simulating the breakdown
voltage of a PMOS transistor. This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Process simulation of a MOS transistor in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Process parameter extraction (eg. oxide thicknesses)
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Autointerface between Athena and DevEdit
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Remeshing using DevEdit
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Autointerface between DevEdit and Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Solution for a Vds ramp with Vgs=0.0V to get breakdown
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The process simulation, process parameter extraction and electrode
definition for this example are exactly as described in the first
example in this section.
</p>
<p>
The grid requirements for Atlas simulation of impact ionization effects
are more stringent than for the low electric field cases described
earlier.
<b> DevEdit </b> is used to remesh the Athena structure before proceeding to Atlas.
The remeshing commands are described in the previous example in this section.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas simulation contains similar syntax to the simpler examples
described earlier in this section. The models, contact and interface
parameters are the same, except that the concentration dependent SRH
model is used. This provides a more accurate simulation of the
pre-breakdown leakage current. The Selberherr impact ionization model
is also selected.
</p>
<p>
On the method statement two parameters are chosen to restrict the use
of the current convergence criteria used in Atlas. Since the
pre-breakdown leakage current is very low, it is necessary to tighten
the tolerances on current convergence. The parameter setting
<b> method climit=1e-4 </b> is also recommended in cases where the mesh is not as tight as the one
used here.
</p>
<p>
The sequence of solve statements shows a ramp in drain voltage.
Small steps are taken at first, but the main simulation is performed in 0.5V
steps. A compliance limit of 5.0e-8A/um is set on the drain. Compliance
limits are useful in breakdown simulations to stop the simulation once
the breakdown point is reached.
</p>
<p>
The value used here might seem rather low compared to typical values
used in measurements. This is simply an issue of CPU time. Running the
simulation up into microamp or milliamp ranges is possible, however the
extra information gained is usually not worth the CPU time spent. Once
the voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage no solutions will be
possible. Atlas will cut the voltage step and try again. It does this
four times resulting in a minimum step of (0.5)^4 or 0.0625V. This is
sufficient to resolve most breakdown voltages.  It is possible for
users to ramp using smaller voltage steps, to use current boundary
conditions, or curve tracing to further trace the IV curve to higher
values of current. However this is not usually needed. Much extra CPU
time might be required and yet the value of breakdown voltage remains
the same to within the accuracy expected by simulation. Examples
demonstrating snapback and curve tracing are included in other
sections.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> extract </b> syntax used to measure the breakdown voltage is of the current search
type. This is preferred over the simple max(v.&quot;drain&quot;) syntax that could
be used as it gives more consistent results.
