This is a basic MOS Athena to Atlas interface example simulating two Id/Vgs
curves at different drain biases and extracting the drain-induced
barrier lowering (DIBL) parameter. This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Process simulation of a MOS transistor in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Process parameter extraction (eg. oxide thicknesses)
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Autointerface between Athena and Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simple Id/Vgs curve generation with Vds=-0.1V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Ramp of drain voltage
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simple Id/Vgs curve generation with Vds=-3.0V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Parameter extraction for the DIBL parameter
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The process simulation, process parameter extraction and electrode
definition for this example are exactly as described in the first
example in this section.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas, the models, interface and contact statements are also the same
as in the first example. The extraction of the first Id/Vgs curve is very
similar to the previous threshold voltage extraction example.
</p>
<p>
One difference is the use of the syntax
<b> compl=1.1e-7 cname=drain</b> . This sets a compliance limit on the drain current.  Although the SOLVE
statement calls for a ramp in gate voltage from zero to -1.5V, once the
trigger current specified by
<b> compl </b> is exceeded on the electrode specified by
<b> cname </b> then the gate voltage ramp will step and Atlas will execute the next
line of syntax. Note that the compliance value does not need to be
signed. A current more negative than -1.1e-7 will also trigger the
compliance limit. Compliances are more commonly used in breakdown
simulations but can be used in this way to stop voltage ramps once the
area of interest is passed.
</p>
<p>
All results from the first Id/Vgs curve are saved to the file specified
by the first log statement.
In Atlas the only way to stop the IV points
being saved is either to specify another LOG statement or to use
<b> log off </b> or exit the simulator.
Here,
<b> log off </b> is used to stop the output from the drain voltage ramp being
saved to the Id/Vgs logfile specified previously.
</p>
<p>
The second &apos;solve init&apos; statement resets all applied voltages to zero.
Then the drain is ramped to -3.0V and the gate ramp with compliance is
repeated.
</p>
<p>
After each gate ramp, the threshold voltage was extracted using a
different syntax than the PMOS threshold voltage example described
earlier in this section. In this example the threshold is determined by
looking for the voltage where the drain current reaches a user-defined
value. The syntax
<b> x.val from curve (x,y) where y.val=&lt;number&gt; </b> is used. At large drain biases this method is preferred for threshold
extraction over the steepest slope approach. The search value of
0.1uA/um of current is typical for channel lengths around 1um.
These thresholds are
stored as values pvt1 and pvt2 in DeckBuild. The final extract
statement is used to obtain the DIBL parameter. It is the difference in
threshold voltage divided by the difference in the drain bias.
