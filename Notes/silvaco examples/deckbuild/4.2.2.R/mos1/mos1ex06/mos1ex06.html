This is a MOS Athena/DevEdit/Atlas interface example simulating substrate and
gate current versus gate bias using energy balance and impact
ionization models. This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Process simulation of a MOS transistor in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Process parameter extraction (eg. oxide thicknesses)
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Autointerface between Athena and DevEdit
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Remeshing using DevEdit
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Autointerface between DevEdit and Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Solution for a Vgs ramp with Vds=3.3V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Parameter extraction for maximum gate and substrate currents
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The process simulation, process parameter extraction and electrode
definition for this example are exactly as described in the first
example in this section.
</p>
<p>
The grid requirements for Atlas simulation of impact ionization effects
are more stringent than for the low electric field cases described
earlier.
<b> DevEdit </b> is used to remesh the Athena structure before proceeding to Atlas.
DevEdit has two modes. The graphical mode allows users to draw and
interactively edit regions and impurities. The batch mode used here
executes structure and mesh commands similar to these. The syntax used
by DevEdit is described in the DevEdit manual. It can be constructed
from the DeckBuild Command menu, or most commonly mesh edits made during
a graphical session can be saved as a &apos;command file&apos; from the SAVE menu of
DevEdit.
</p>
<p>
The imp.refine commands specify regrids on impurities. Here a regrid on
net doping is performed.  The constr.mesh command defines the base mesh. The
refine commands specify mesh refinements inside boxes specified by the
coordinates in each statement.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas simulation contains similar syntax to the simple examples
described earlier in this section. The solution of the energy balance
equations for electrons is specified by the parameter
<b> hcte.el </b> The parameter
<b> hei </b> specifies the hot carrier injection model, which gives the gate
current.  The equivalent hcte.ho and hhi exist for holes but is not
required in NMOS simulation.
</p>
<p>
The impact ionization model is selected on the impact statement. The
parameter lrel.el sets the relaxation time for electrons in this
model.  Although the hei model is directly responsible for the gate
current, there is no &apos;special&apos; model required to simulate substrate
current.  Running this sweep of gate voltage with a high drain bias and
including impact ionization and energy balance supplies all the
necessary physics. The substrate current can simply be plotted from the
log file in a similar manner to the drain current. No special extraction of
substrate current is needed.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> extract </b> statements used in this run extract the peak value and position of the
substrate and gate currents. The value of the peak current is measured
first. This result is then used in a current search to find the gate
voltage where this current is measured.
