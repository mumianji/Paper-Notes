This is a basic MOS Athena to Atlas interface example demonstrating the
simulation of a family of Id/Vds curves. The maximum drive current and
saturation slope are extracted.  No advanced features are used in this
example so as to demonstrate simple functionality. This example
demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Process simulation of a MOS transistor in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Process parameter extraction (eg. oxide thicknesses)
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Autointerface between Athena and Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vds curve generation with Vgs=-1.1, -2.2 and -3.3V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 IV Curve parameter extraction for Idmax and saturation slope
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The process simulation, process parameter extraction and electrode
definition for this example are exactly as described in the first
PMOS example in this section.
</p>
<p>
A more advanced sequence of solve statements is used for this example.
Three Id/Vds curves are required at different gate voltages. The first
part of the solve sequence sets up the initial point of the three
curves. For each of the three gate voltages a solution with Vds=0.0
is simulated and the results saved to a solution file.
</p>
<p>
Each of these three solution files are then loaded in turn into Atlas. A
log file is opened and the ramp of Vds is set. When a file is loaded the
voltages in Atlas are reset to the values in the file.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the simulation,
<b> extract </b> is used to measure the peak current and the saturation slope. From the
shape of the Id/Vds curves the saturation slope is clearly the minimum
value of the gradient along the curve as long as the absolute values of
current and voltage are taken. Finally the three Id/Vds curves are
overlaid in TonyPlot.
