Basic MOS Athena to Atlas interface example simulating an Id/Vgs curve
and extracting threshold voltage and other SPICE parameters.  No
advanced features are used in this example so as to demonstrate simple
functionality. This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Process simulation of a MOS transistor in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Process parameter extraction (eg. oxide thicknesses)
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Autointerface between Athena and Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Aimple Id/Vgs curve generation with Vds=0.1V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Parameter extraction for Vt, linear gain (beta) and mobility
rolloff (theta)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The process simulation in SSuprem 4 follows a standard LDD MOS process.
The process steps are simplified and default models are used to give a
fast runtime. The polysilicon gate is formed by a simple geometrical
etch. Before this point the simulation is essentially one dimensional
and hence is run in Athena&apos;s 1D mode. After the poly etch, the structure
converts to 2D.
</p>
<p>
The grid used in this example is defined quite tightly. However the statement
<b> init ...  spac.mult=3 </b> relaxes the mesh in X and Y directions by a factor of three. A more
typical mesh for MOS simulation can be obtained by setting
<b> spac.mult=1</b> .
</p>
<p>
Using DeckBuild&apos;s auto-interface, the process simulation structure will
be passed into Atlas automatically. This auto-interface therefore
allows global optimization from process simulation to device simulation
to SPICE model parameter extraction.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> extract </b> statement at the end of the file is used
to calculate the oxide thickness at that point. The value returned here
may be used as an optimization target for calibration. Refer to the
<b> Interactive Tools of the Virtual Wafer Fab </b> manual for instruction in the use of the
<b> Optimizer</b> . This value will be appended to a file in the current working directory called
<b> results.final. </b> When using the VWF automation tools,
<b> extract </b> values are logged to the worksheet for RSM modeling.  Significant use of
<b> extract </b> statements is strongly recommended, especially at points where in-line
Fab measurements are taken.
</p>
<p>
Electrodes are defined at the end of the process simulation. Metal is
deposited and patterned. Then
<b> electrode </b> statements are used to define the metal regions plus the polysilicon as
electrodes for use in Atlas.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas the first task is to define the models and material parameters
for the simulation. The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to define the
workfunction of the gate electrodes, while the
<b> interface </b> statement defines the fixed charge at the silicon/oxide interface.
For simple MOS simulation the parameters CVT and SRH define the
recommended models.
<b> CVT </b> sets a
general purpose mobility model including concentration, temperature,
parallel field and transverse field dependence. For more complete MOS
simulations of short channel lengths, energy balance simulation might
be used.
</p>
<p>
The statement
<b> solve init </b> is used to solve the thermal equilibrium case. After this the voltages
can be ramped. It is recommended to use small steps at first when
ramping voltages. Once two non-zero biases have been obtained, the
program uses a projection as initial guesses to further bias points.
The projection method allows larger voltage steps to be taken. The syntax
<b> method trap </b> enables Atlas to cut
user-defined voltage steps in half if convergence is not obtained.
This is a highly recommended option and is turned on by default.
</p>
<p>
The unique feature of this example is the IV data simulated and the
extraction syntax used. The model, interface and  contact
statements in
Atlas are also as in the previous example.
</p>
<p>
The sequence of
<b> solve  </b> statements is set to ramp the gate bias with the
drain voltage at 0.1V. Solutions are obtained at 0.25V intervals up to
3.0V. All terminal characteristics are saved to the file mos1ex02_1.log
as specified in the
<b> log </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> extract </b> statements at the end of the file are used to measure the threshold
voltage and other SPICE parameters. The results from the extract
statements are printed in the run-time output, saved to a file called
results.final and optionally used in the optimizer or VWF automation
tools. The syntax used in these statements is freely composed of
operators such as maximum value (max) and simulation results such as
drain current (i.&quot;drain&quot;). The
<b> name </b> parameter specifies only a user-defined label. The routines are not
hard-coded to these names. Thus the first extraction statement reads:
extract the value called nvt found by taking the x intercept of the
maximum slope to the curve of drain voltage vs. drain current and
subtracting half the drain voltage. This is just one possible definition of
threshold voltage. Current search methods are also possible and are
described under the DIBL example later in this section. The VWF
interactive tools manual has details of the extract syntax.
</p>
<p>
The second extract statement measures the gain (or Beta). This is
defined as the value of the steepest slope to the Id/Vgs curve divided
by the drain voltage. The final extraction is for the SPICE level 3
mobility roll-off parameter (or Theta). This syntax shows the use of
the syntax:
<b> $&quot;nvt&quot; </b> and
<b> $&quot;nbeta&quot;</b> . This tells DeckBuild to substitute the previously extracted values of
threshold and beta into this places in the equation.
