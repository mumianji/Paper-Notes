This is a basic MOS Athena to Atlas interface example simulating an Id/Vgs curve
and extracting threshold voltage and other SPICE parameters.  No
advanced features are used in this example so as to demonstrate simple
functionality. This example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Process simulation of a MOS transistor in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Process parameter extraction (eg. oxide thicknesses)
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Autointerface between Athena and Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simple Id/Vgs curve generation with Vds=-0.1V
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 IV Curve parameter extraction for Vt, Beta and Theta
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The process simulation, process parameter extraction and electrode
definition for this example are exactly as described in the first
example in this section.
</p>
<p>
The unique feature of this example is the IV data simulated and the
extraction syntax used. The
<b> model, interface </b> and
<b> contact</b> statements in
Atlas are also as in the previous example.
</p>
<p>
The sequence of SOLVE statements is set to ramp the gate bias with the
drain voltage at -0.1V. Solutions are obtained at -0.25V intervals up to
-3.0V. All terminal characteristics are saved to the file mos1ex02_1.log
as specified in the LOG statement.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> extract </b> statement at the end of the file are used to measure the threshold
voltage and other SPICE parameters. The results from the extract
statements are printed in the run-time output, saved to a file called
results.final, and optionally used in the optimizer or VWF automation
tools. The syntax used in these statements is freely composed of
operators such as maximum value (max) and simulation results such as
drain current (i.&quot;drain&quot;). One operator of particular use in PMOS device extraction is
<b> abs()</b> . This takes the absolute value of a variable and can be used to
make all PMOS and NMOS extractions equivalent.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> name </b> parameter specifies a user-defined label. The routines are not
hard-coded to these names. Thus the first extraction statement reads:
extract the value called pvt found by taking the x intercept of the
maximum slope to the curve of drain voltage vs. drain current and
subtracting half the drain voltage. This is just one definition of
threshold voltage. Current search methods are also possible and are
described under the DIBL example later in this section. The VWF
interactive tools manual has details of the EXTRACT syntax.
</p>
<p>
The second extract statement measures the gain (or Beta). This is
defined as the value of the steepest slope to the Id/Vgs curve divided
by the drain voltage. The final extraction is for the SPICE level 3
mobility roll-off parameter (or Theta). This syntax shows the use of
the syntax:
<b> $&quot;pvt&quot; </b> and
<b> $&quot;pbeta&quot;</b> . This tells DeckBuild to use the previously extracted values of
threshold and beta in the equation.
