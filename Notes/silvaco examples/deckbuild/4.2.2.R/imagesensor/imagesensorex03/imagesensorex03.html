In this example we attempt to look at the crosstalk between adjacent
colors due to angularly incident light.  In this case we simulate two
adjacent pixels; one red and one green.  We then obtain solutions
as a function of angle of incidence and collect the integrated
photogeneration rate as a measure of the relative charge collected
in each of the adjacent pixels.  This measure can be used to quantify
crosstalk as a function of angle of incidence.
</p>
<p>
The simulations begins with a description of the device
structure and mesh using the
<b> MESH</b> ,
<b> X.M</b> ,
<b> Y.M</b> ,
<b> REGION</b> ,
<b> ELEC</b> , and
<b> DOPING </b> statements.
</p>
<p>
In this example we add a couple of extra oxide regions to represent the
color filters for the adjacent pixels.  The optical characteristics of
these regions will be modified to pass or not pass the source
light.
</p>
<p>
Next, we specify some material models and parameter defaults.  Of
significance is the specification of the complex index of refraction
of aluminum using the
<b> REAL.INDEX</b> and
<b> IMAG.INDEX</b> parameters
of the
<b> MATERIAL</b> statement.  In this case we set the imaginary
index to a very high value.  This makes the aluminum blocking
regions highly reflective/absorptive to light.
</p>
<p>
Here we also specify the imaginary index of the red filter.  In this case
the thickness of the filter was used to calculate an index that will absorb
99% of the incident light.  We do not need to specify the index of the
green filter since it is assumed to pass all of the incident light.
</p>
<p>
Next we specify the optical source on the
<b> BEAM</b> statement.  We
specify the light with normal incidence from above with a wavelength
of 0.5325 microns.  This wavelength corresponds to the band pass of
the green filter.  We also define the sampling in the FDTD mesh.
This sampling should typically be a small fraction of the incident
wavelength.  The
<b> TD.WAVES</b> parameter specifies how many source
wavelengths are propogated in this simulation.  Finally, we specify
a file for capture of the structure as represented in the final
FDTD mesh solution.  This is useful to examine the interference
and diffraction patterns that might not be otherwise discernable in
the standard finite-difference structure file.
</p>
<p>
Next, we specify the lenslets above the two pixels.
</p>
<p>
We add perfectly matched layers (PMLs) at the top and bottom of the FDTD domain
to absorb reflected and transmitted light.  This is specified on the
<b> PML</b> statements.
</p>
<p>
After obtaining the initial solution, we define probes using the
<b> PROBE</b> statement to allow us to measure the integrated photogeneration rate as
a function of wavelength in both of the green and red sensor wells.
It is important to notice
that we specified the
<b> FDTD</b> parameter on the
<b> PROBE</b> statement.
This indicates that the integration of the generation rate will take place
in the FDTD analysis domain.  The FDTD domain presents a more accurate
estimate since some loss is expected during interpolation to the
finite-difference domain.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we capture the solutions for various angles as specified by the
<b> ANGLE</b> parameter of the
<b> SOLVE</b> statement.  These angles were selected to provide integer numbers of
wavelengths in phase shift at the edges of the source.
</p>
<p>
When the simulation is complete we can look at the integrated photogeneration
rates in the adjacent wells as a function of angle of incidence.  Here we
can see that after about 20 degrees, the collected green rate decreases and
the collected red rate begins to increase.  This information is very useful
in designing the collection system of the camera.
