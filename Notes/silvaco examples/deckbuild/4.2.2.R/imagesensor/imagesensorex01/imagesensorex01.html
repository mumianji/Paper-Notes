This example shows how finite difference time domain (FDTD) analysis can
be applied to optimization of lenslet design for an microlens image
sensor.
</p>
<p>
In this example we will use the built-in analytic lens specification
defined on the
<b> LENS </b> statement.  This allows us to define lenslets
considered during FDTD analysis but does not impact the drift diffusion
analysis.  The advantage of lenslets is that extra
mesh points are not added into the device analysis part of the simulation.
</p>
<p>
There are several different lens forms supported by FDTD in Luminous2D
and Luminous3D.  These include spherical, elliptical, pyramidal,
composite and aspheric types.  The composite lenslet is formed by a
planar face with cylindrical and spherical roll off at the edges.  The
aspheric lenslet is defined by a 10th order polynomial fitted to
measured h-sag data using a Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least
squares algorithm.
</p>
<p>
The device in this example is defined simply by a buried N well
under the lens and light blocking structures.  In this case we
are less concerned with the electrical operation of the device
than the light collection capability.
</p>
<p>
In this example we compare six lens designs in six simulations.
In all six cases the geometry is the same with the exception
of the lens height.  The lenslet width is fixed at 8 microns
and the height is varried from 0.5 to 3.5 microns in half micron
steps.  Simple geometrical calculations give six lens radii
and associated lens centers for the cases.
</p>
<p>
We will characterize the lenslet light gathering capability based on
the integrated photogeneration rate in the N well region.  This
is done using the
<b> PROBE</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
Each of the six simulations begins with a description of the device
structure and mesh using the
<b> MESH</b> ,
<b> X.M</b> ,
<b> Y.M</b> ,
<b> REGION</b> ,
<b> ELEC</b> , and
<b> DOPING </b> statements.
</p>
<p>
Next, we specify some material models and parameter defaults.  Of
significance is the specification of the complex index of refraction
of aluminum using the
<b> REAL.INDEX</b> and
<b> IMAG.INDEX</b> parameters
of the
<b> MATERIAL</b> statement.  In this case we set the imaginary
index to a very high value.  This makes the aluminum blocking
regions highly reflective/absorptive to light.
</p>
<p>
Next we specify the optical source on the
<b> BEAM</b> statement.  We
specify the light with normal incidence from above with a wavelength
of 0.415 microns.  This is only a nominal wavelength and is never used
since we will define the analysis wavelengths explicitly on the subsequent
<b> SOLVE</b> statments.  We also define the sampling in the FDTD mesh.
This sampling should typically be a small fraction of the incident
wavelength.  The
<b> TD.WAVES</b> parameter specifies how many source
wavelengths are propogated in this simulation.  Finally, we specify
a file for capture of the structure as represented in the final
FDTD mesh solution.  This is useful to examine the interference
and diffraction patterns that might not be otherwise discernable in
the standard finite-difference structure file.
</p>
<p>
Next, we specify the lenslet.  The six cases will be differentiated
by the location of the center along the y axis,
<b> Y.LOC</b> and the
radius,
<b> RADIUS</b> .
</p>
<p>
We add perfectly matched layers (PMLs) at the top and bottom of the FDTD domain
to absorb reflected and transmitted light.  This is specified on the
<b> PML</b> statements.
</p>
<p>
After obtaining the initial solution, we define a probe using the
<b> PROBE</b> statement to allow us to measure the integrated photogeneration rate as
a function of wavelength for each lens design.  It is important to notice
that we specified the
<b> FDTD</b> parameter on the
<b> PROBE</b> statement.
This indicates that the integration of the generation rate will take place
in the FDTD analysis domain.  The FDTD domain presents a more accurate
estimate since some loss is expected during interpolation to the
finite-difference domain.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we capture the solutions for various wavelengths over the visible
spectrum.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the simulations we will have two data sets to consider.  First,
we will produce optical intensity plots of the six lenslet designs under
green illumination.  In comparing these plots we can see that focusing is
better under the taller lenslets.
</p>
<p>
Second, we can overlay the integrated generation rate curves versus
optical wavelength.  This verifies that the 3.5 micron lens height
produces the best light collection.
