This examples shows the creation and calibration of a 3.3 Volt CMOS Image
Sensor (CIS), using a standard 10 ohm-cm epitaxy process.  The
Image Sensor is created using Athena process simulation and monte-carlo
implantation.
</p>
<p>
The pass transistors have a high threshold voltage of approximately 2.5 volts
to minimize leakage currents in their off state.  Since the signal output
contact of the image sensor is floating, the threshold voltage of the two
pass transistors is determined by using the
<b> probe</b> statement, whereby the electron concentration under their gates, tg_conc and
rst_conc, are used to determine the relative conductivity of the channel,
rather than the usual drain current plot.
</p>
<p>
The first transient simulates what happens when the image sensor is depleted
of electrons, and is simply left to integrate thermally generated charge
(leakage current) in the dark for a period of 10 seconds.  The
transient_dark.log plot shows that the concentration of electrons in the
depleted image sensor well, starts to rise after approximately 0.1 seconds,
so this effectively sets a maximum integration time limit on the image sensor
to obtain a normal contrast image.
</p>
<p>
The second set of transients, numbering 10 in all, calibrate the image sensor
output for a typical light intensity range that would be expected in a normal
out door setting.  The simulated intensity range was one order of magnitude,
between 0.02 and 0.2 times the intensity of a standard solar AM-1.5 spectrum.
It was found that the optimum integration time for such a photograph with
this intensity range, was approximately 7.5e-04 seconds for this particular
image sensor.  This integration time indicates the image sensor can be used
in a range from bright sunshine images down to an average intensity of
approximately four orders of magnitude less than this.
</p>
<p>
The 10 simulations for the different intensities for written using the loop
capability in deckbuild.  The loops are bounded by the deckbuild syntax
<b> loop steps=16 </b> and
<b> l.end </b> The values of intensity are increased inside each loop for each simulation
using deckbuild&apos;s
<b> set </b> statements, which assign a value to the light intensity variable defined in
the set statement.
</p>
<p>
The output signal voltage of the image sensor is taken from the common
source / drain contact of the two series pass transistors.  In order to save
the complication of creating a separate contact at this location, and then
defining this contact as a high resistance voltage sense contact, the probe
statement was used once again, to probe the potential at this location.
</p>
<p>
The figure of image sensor output voltage (fd_potential) versus light
integration time up to the chosen integration time of 7.5e-5 seconds, shows
the effect of light intensity variation on the output voltage.  The output
voltage at the final time of 7.5e-5 seconds is the final outptut signal of the
image sensor and is captured by an
<b> extract </b> statement.  The values of the extract statement were then collated in the
final plot and show the output signal characteristics of the image sensor
versus light intensity reflected from an image.
