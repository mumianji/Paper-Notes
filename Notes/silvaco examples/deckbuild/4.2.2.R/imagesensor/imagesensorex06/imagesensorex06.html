By default Victory Process and Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot; </b> could be specidied in the
<b> go </b> line starting Victory Process or Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
This examples demonstrates solutions to some of the particular 3D process
and device issues when simulating a 3D image sensor cell.  The first issue
with a number of designs is the
<b> very high implantation energies </b> required to isolate the active region of the image sensor.
</p>
<p>
If 3D Monte-Carlo Implantation is used to simulate these high energy implants,
the simulation times can be excessive.  The solution is to simulate these
implants as a single spot in Athena and then to extract the depth and lateral
spreading of the implants using
<b> deckbuild&apos;s extract statements. </b> This creates an accurate data file of the implant, which can then be imported
into Victory cell using the
<b> profile statement </b> and incorporated into the 3D structure when required using the implant
statement.
</p>
<p>
The device simulation is in three parts.  Firstly the threshold voltage
of the two pass transistors is simulated.  Then a dark transient is simulated
to find the dark current recovery time, which sets the low light sensitivity
limit of the image sensor, ie the maximum useable light integration time.
Finally a simulastion is done illuminating the device with a typical average
light intensity of 0.01 Watts/cm2 with a standard solar AM 1.5 spectrum,
which for this sesnor, would require an integration time of approximately
0.0008 for a 50% exposure level.  The illumination intensity and exposure
integration time can both be adjusted by changing these two variable
quantities at the
<b> set statement </b> lines, near the top of the inpu file for the final device simulation.
</p>
<p>
The threshold voltage of the pass transistors is
deliberately high to ensure that charge leakage in their off state is
minimized.  Since the pass transisotrs have a common floating electrode
without an ohmic contact, the threshold voltage is plotted using the
electron concentration under the gates.  The electron concentrations are
measwured using
<b> probe </b> statemnts, which probe the silicon surface under the gates. In this example,
the probe quantities have been called
<b> &quot;cg_conc&quot; </b> and
<b> &quot;ng_conc&quot;</b> .
</p>
<p>
For the transient simulations, the output voltage of the cell can be monitored
in tonyplot by plotting the probe quantity called
<b> fd_potential</b> . Another interesting quantity also extracted using the
probe statement is the electron concentration in the active image sensor
region.  This image sensor electron concentration is called
<b>&quot;cis_conc&quot; </b> in this example.
