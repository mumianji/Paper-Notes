In this example we examine the time integration of charge in the N well
of the imaging device and look at crosstalk caused by charge blooming
into an adjacent cell.  In this case we simulate two half cells representing
adjacent red and green pixels.  This implies that we will implement color
separation filtering and perform integration of charge during a time domain
simulation.
</p>
<p>
The simulation begins with a description of the device
structure and mesh using the
<b> MESH</b> ,
<b> X.M</b> ,
<b> Y.M</b> ,
<b> REGION</b> ,
<b> ELEC</b> , and
<b> DOPING </b> statements.
</p>
<p>
In this example we add a couple of extra oxide regions to represent the
color filters for the adjacent pixels.  The optical characteristics of
these regions will be modified to pass or not pass the source
light.
</p>
<p>
Next, we specify some material models and parameter defaults.  Of
significance is the specification of the complex index of refraction
of aluminum using the
<b> REAL.INDEX</b> and
<b> IMAG.INDEX</b> parameters
of the
<b> MATERIAL</b> statement.  In this case we set the imaginary
index to a very high value.  This makes the aluminum blocking
regions highly reflective/absorptive to light.
</p>
<p>
Here we also specify the imaginary index of the red filter.  In this case
the thickness of the filter was used to calculate an index that will absorb
99% of the incident light.  We do not need to specify the index of the
green filter since it is assumed to pass all of the incident light.
</p>
<p>
Next we specify the optical source on the
<b> BEAM</b> statement.  We
specify the light with normal incidence from above with a wavelength
of 0.5325 microns. This wavelength corresponds to the band pass of
the green filter.  We also define the sampling in the FDTD mesh.
This sampling should typically be a small fraction of the incident
wavelength.  The
<b> TD.WAVES</b> parameter specifies how many source
wavelengths are propogated in this simulation.  Finally, we specify
a file for capture of the structure as represented in the final
FDTD mesh solution.  This is useful to examine the interference
and diffraction patterns that might not be otherwise discernable in
the standard finite-difference structure file.
</p>
<p>
Next, we specify the lenslets above the two pixels.
</p>
<p>
We add perfectly matched layers (PMLs) at the top and bottom of the FDTD domain
to absorb reflected and transmitted light.  This is specified on the
<b> PML</b> statements.
</p>
<p>
After obtaining the initial solution, we define probes using the
<b> PROBE</b> statement to allow us to measure the integrated electron concentration as
a function of time for green and red pixel wells.
</p>
<p>
Next we empty the well for the initial conditions.  To empty the well, we
perform a zero carrier solution with the electron quasi-Fermi level set
to a very high potential.  This insures that the electron concentration
is negligible.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we quickly ramp the beam up to an &apos;on&apos; state and continue to
integrate the charge over 1 micro-second.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the simulation we can plot the integrated charge in the
two wells to see at what time a) the green well charge saturates and
b) when the red well charge begins to increase due to charge blooming
out of the green well.
</p>
<p>
We then plot the electron concentration in the final structure.  This shows
how the electrons have diffused out over the barrier between the two
collection wells.
