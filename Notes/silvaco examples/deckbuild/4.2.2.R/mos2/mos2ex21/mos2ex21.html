By default Victory Process and Device run on just one processor.
To ensure better perfomance on your computer the following simulation condition
<b> simflags=&quot;-P all&quot; </b> could be specidied in the
<b> go </b> line starting Victory Process or Device. This means that all processors available will be used.
If you want to use a smaller number of processors you can substitute &quot;all&quot; with a desired number, e.g.
<b> simflags=&quot;-P 4&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>
In this example, a FinFET is created using the etch, deposit, diffusion and
Monte-Carlo implantation modules of Victory Process.
</p>
<p>
The structure created by Victory Process is then meshed in Victory Mesh using a full 3D Delaunay mesh and is then transferred to Victory Device for electrical analysis of the unsaturated Vt curves as well IdVd curves
</p>
<p>
The device simulation uses the
<b> energy balance model </b> to account for the effects of
<b> ballistic carrier transport</b> , which significantly increases drain currents and is the cause of the decrease
in the output impedance of the IdVd curves.
</p>
<p>
It also uses the
<b>  Bohm Quantum Potential (BQP)</b> model to take into account quantum
confinement of carriers in 3 dimension which significantly decreases the drain currents.
</p>
<p>
For comparison purpose Drift Diffusion are also included in the simulation
