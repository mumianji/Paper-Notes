This example shows the effects of device degradation caused by stressing a
transistor at a negative gate bias and an elevated temperature.  The used
model is based on hole trapping into the gate oxide but also accounts for
the permanent component by an interface reaction.  The example shows how to:
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Create a PMOS structure using the Atlas syntax and refine 
the simulation grid in the gate oxide.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Set up a deck with the four-state NMP model enabled.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulate the temporal response of oxide and interface traps 
during a stress and a relaxation phase.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Visualize the local degradation using the hole occupancy of 
the oxide traps.
  </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
The input file consists of three separate runs, where each of them starts
with
<b> go atlas.</b> In the first section, the geometry, the mesh, the electrodes, and the doping
of the simulated device are specified using the statements
<b> mesh,</b> <b> region,</b> <b> electrodes, </b> and
<b> doping,</b> respectively.  Since the four-state NMP model requires a fine mesh in the
gate oxide region between the substrate and the gate, the mesh is refined
based on the potential using the statement
<b> regrid.</b> The resulting structure is saved in an output file called mos2ex23_0.str.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
In the next section, ATLAS is restarted and the refined structure is read
in again.  Then the four-state NMP model is enabled by the parameter
<b> nmp4.sto</b> after the
<b> trap </b> statement.  The oxide traps are placed into the material
<b> sio2</b> and confined to the region defined by coordinates
<b> x.min, </b> <b> x.max, </b> <b> y.min,</b> and
<b> y.max.</b> Their oxide and interface state density are set to 1e20/cm3 and 1e11/cm2,
respectively.  The parameter
<b> nmp4.sample </b> specifies the number of simulated traps at each gate oxide point.  In this
example, a small number of traps have been chosen in order to reduce the
computation time.  However, this number should be increased for more
realistic simulations, especially if one is interested in the degradation
of large-area devices.  The traps have distributed parameters, given by
their mean values and their variance.  The meaning of each of those
parameters is described in the ATLAS user manual.  Furthermore, the traps
are enabled to capture/emit charge carriers from/to the silicon substrate
by setting the parameter
<b> subcontact </b> to the material
<b> silicon.</b> </p>
<br/>
<p>
Next, the device is simulated for steady-state conditions using the
statements
<b> solve init</b> and
<b> solve prev.</b> The obtained oxide and interface trap charges correspond to their
respective pre-stress levels and are saved in the structure file
mos2ex23_1.str that will be used for the extraction of the threshold
voltages in the last section.  Note that the
<b> output</b> statement requires the flag
<b> devdeg </b> for saving the trap charges in the output file mos2ex23_1.str.  The
stored charges are visualized using TONYPLOT.  The figure clearly shows
that the trapped charges are inhomogeneously distributed in the gate
oxide due to the assumed defect-to-defect variations in the amorphous SiO2
gate oxide.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
In the next step, the device is stressed by applying a gate bias of
-1.55 V for 1 s, including an initial ramptime of 1e-6 s.  The
temperature of this stress phase is set 100 C by
<b> model temp=373.</b> The bias temperature stress leads to a device degradation, saved in the
output file mos2ex23_2.str. The gate oxide is found to have an increased
concentration of trapped holes compared to the pre-stress level.  The
stress period is followed by a relaxation phase of 1e3 s at 0 V, where
the degradation at the end of this phase is saved in the structure file
mos2ex23_3.str.  The TONYPLOT figure demonstrates that a substantial
fraction of the trapped charges has been removed during device recovery.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
For studying critical spots in the gate oxide, the local degradation may
be of interest.  Therefore, the corresponding
<b> output </b> statements are followed by the flags
<b> u.trantrap </b> and
<b> traps </b> in order to write out the trap occupation probabilities at a specified
position within the gate oxide.  This position together with the requested
states
<b> msc.state </b> must be set after the
<b> probe </b> statement.  In this input deck, the stress and relaxation data are written
out into the log file mos2ex23_1.log and mos2ex23_2.log, respectively.  In
both phases, the plotted degradation curves show a behavior that is almost
logarithmic and therefore reminiscent of negative bias temperature
instability.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
In the following section, ATLAS is restarted.  In a loop, the trapped oxide
and interface charges of the unstressed, the stressed, and the relaxed
device are loaded and a gate bias sweep is performed.  The calculated output
characteristics are recorded in the log files mos2ex23_3.log, mos2ex23_4.log,
and mos2ex23_5.log, respectively.  The comparison of the Id(Vg) curves
demonstrates a pronounced shift of the threshold voltage due to hole
trapping at the end of the stress phase.  The following relaxation period
of 1e3 s leads to an incomplete recovery of the device degradation.
