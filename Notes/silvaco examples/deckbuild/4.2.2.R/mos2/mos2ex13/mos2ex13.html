This example demonstrates a comparison of Id/Vds analyses including
second breakdown of a short PMOS structure with a SiGe channel using
the non-isothermal Energy Balance (NEB) models.
It shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Specification of PMOS structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of abrupt SiGe heterojunctions
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Selection of the energy balance model, lattice heat flow solution
and coupled solver
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulation of Id/Vds characteristic for Vgs=-1.0V
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Many of the models and methods required for Id/Vds and breakdown
simulation are described in the snapback and second breakdown examples
in the MOS examples section. Some tips in defining SiGe structures are
also given in the HBT examples section. Users should consult both these
sections for more details on these two areas.
</p>
<p>
Submicron devices should be simulated using the energy balance model
due to velocity overshoot, and nonlocal impact ionization effects,
which could substantially influence device characteristics. For high
current levels the thermal self-heating effects could also play an
important role decreasing mobility and impact ionization rate. This
example demonstrates comparison of Id/Vds curves obtained with energy
balance and nonisothermal energy balance models. The curve tracing
algorithm is used to obtain these curves.
</p>
<p>
The example contains two Atlas runs. The first uses non-isothermal
energy balance simulation of an Id/Vds curve and the second repeats
this simulation without the lattice heating model.
</p>
<p>
The device is described in the first part of the input file, including
mesh, regions locations, electrodes locations, and doping distribution.
The
<b> region </b> statements are used to define SiO2, Si and SiGe regions. The Ge
composition fraction is defined  using
<b> x.composition=&lt;num&gt; </b> Since no grad.* parameters were used on the region statement the Ge
composition fraction has an abrupt change from 0.25 to zero at the
region boundary. This constitutes the abrupt heterojunction.
Discontinuities in band potentials will be seen at the SiGe/Si region
boundaries.
</p>
<p>
After the device description the
<b> material </b> statements are used to specify the electron and hole lifetimes, hole
energy relaxation times both in Si and SiGe, and Nc and Nv in SiGe.
The
<b> model hcte.ho lat.temp </b> statement is used to specify solution of the hole energy balance and
lattice heating equations respectively. Other carrier and lattice
temperature physical models are also set on the same statement.
The
<b> impact </b> statement is used to assign the energy relaxation length for Selberherr model.
</p>
<p>
Thermal boundary conditions are defined in the
<b> thermcontact </b> statement.  A value of the thermal resistance is specified at the thermocontact
located along the substrate, and thermal isolation conditions are assumed on the
all other surfaces.
</p>
<p>
Then the gate voltage is ramped to -2V, and then the curve tracing algorithm
is used for ramping the drain voltage. The
<b> curvetrace </b> statement is used to initialize parameters for the curve tracing algorithm. The
contr.name parameter specifies the name of the electrode for which the load line
technique will be applied (drain in this case). The curr.cont parameter means
that value of current will be monitored, and the simulation will be stopped when
the current exceeds the value specified by end.val parameter.
The mincur parameter defines the minimum current value after which the load
line technique will actually be applied (before that voltage boundary
conditions are used). The nextst.ratio parameter defines the factor which to
use to increase voltage step on the smooth parts of the IV  curve.
The command
<b> solve curvetrace </b> is used to activate the curve tracing algorithm.
</p>
<p>
The second Atlas run uses the same syntax, except that the solution of
the  lattice energy balance equation is turned off in the
<b> models </b> statement. The Id/Vds curves from both runs can be overlaid using
TonyPlot. In plotting the drain voltage the quantity:
<b> drain int. bias </b> should be used in TonyPlot. This is the value of the voltage on the
metal/semiconductor interface at the drain as opposed to &apos;drain bias&apos;
which includes the load resistor used in the curve trace algorithm.
