This examples demonstrates the creation of a self-aligned 20nm n-MOSFET using a
60nm lithography node.  This Silvaco designed process has several advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 The channel implant does not penetrate the gate insulator
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Transient enhanced diffusion effects in the silicon are avoided
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Very low energy implants are avoided
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 20nm gate length devices can be fabricated using 60nm litography
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Non penetration of the gate stack by the channel implants removes the damage
that this implant usually causes.  The source/drain implants are also arranged
in such a way that damage to the silicon is avoided. Transient enhanced
diffusion in the silicon and other damage effects therefore do not occur.
Implant energies of 10keV are used, allowing the use of standard implanters,
and finally the 20nm device can be created with 60nm lithography technology,
thus reducing the cost.

<p>
The stress induced by the nitride spacers is calculated in Athena which is
passed to the Atlas device simulator and converted into strain.  This strain
is used to calculate the strain modified bandgaps and mobilities in the device.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas, the strain dependent bandgap model is invoked by the
<b> STRESS </b> parameter in the
<b> models </b> statement and the strain dependent mobility models are
invoked by the
<b> EGLEY.N </b> and
<b> EGLEY.P </b> parameters in the
<b> mobility </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The output statement adds electron mobility and velocity to the saved structure
files, from which it can be seen that most of the channel is velocity saturated,
or close to it, as a result of the extreme dimensions of this device.  As a
result of these dimensions, the device yields an output current density
exceeding 2000uA/um for Vg=Vd=1.2V
