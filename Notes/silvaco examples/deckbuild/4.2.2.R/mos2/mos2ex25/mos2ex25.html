It is well known that electric field enhancement occurs at the tip of a pointed
structure.  Using this phenomenon, it is possible to create such high fields
with only moderate voltages, that electrons can tunnel from the tip of the
pointed structure directly into the surrounding vacuum.  This process is
analagous to tunnelling through an interfacial energy barrier into a conduction
band, except that the conduction band in this case, is the transmittance of an
electron into the surrounding vacuum, where the path of the now free electron
can then be influenced by any electric fields that exist in that vacuum region.
</p>
<p>
The escape of electrons from a solid into the vacuum from a high field region,
is exactly analagous to the escape of electrons from a solid heated wire.  It
is therefore possible to create devices exactly analagous in operation, to
vacuum valves, only theses field devices can be created in tiny volumes on
silicon chips, rather than be encased in bulky evacuated glass tubes.  The
addition of a control gate and collector electrode to such a silicon device,
therefore allows the creation of silicon based vacuum triodes with useful gain
at relatively low operating voltages.  An added bonus is a natural tolerance to
radiation harsh environments, plus a very low off current, since no current is
required to heat the emitter as occurs in a traditional heated emitter vacuum
valve device.  There is also no reason not to create solid state silicon
versions of pentode valve equivilents etc. for RF applications because of the
analagous nature of the device operational physics.
</p>
<p>
In this example, we demonstrate a pointed field emitting device together
with collector and current control gate electrodes, forming a vacuum triode.
The off state leakage is plotted in mos2ex25_0.log and shows the unintentional
field emission of electrons from the gate electrode to the collector, as the
collector voltage increases to the operating voltage of 20 volts.  However, the
maximum off leakage is still very well controlled at 1e-14 Amps.
</p>
<p>
Once at it&apos;s operating voltage, mos2ex25_1.log shows the gate control plot.
The collected current of this triode can be changed by a minimum of 9 orders of
magnitude, by the gate electrode voltage input, making it a very useful
amplifying device.  As can be seen from the plot, as the gate voltage is
increased, the field between gate and collector reduces, thus reducing this
parasitic current path with increasing gate voltage.  After approximately 2.8
volts of gate bias, the collected current is mostly emitted from the emitter
electrode, rather than the gate electrode.
</p>
<p>
This example makes use of the
<b> Zaidman model,</b> which first calculates the field emission from a semiconductor, into the
vacuum, then the emitted electrons follow the vacuum field lines until they
encounter a metallic electrode.  In this triode design, it is both possible for
the gate electrode to receive electrons from the emitter, as well as emit
electrons to the collector.  So this electrode is made of two parts, one part
metal electrode, to receive electrons from the emitter, and one part
semiconductor to enable transmission of electrons to the collector.  If
electrons in the vacuum encounter an insulator before a metallic electrode, the
electrons travel along the insulator / vacuum boundary, until they encounter a
metallic electrode.
