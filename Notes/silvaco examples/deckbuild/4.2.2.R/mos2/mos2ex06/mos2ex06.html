This example demonstrates the extraction of a BSIM3 SPICE model from Atlas
simulation data of an NMOS transistor. The example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Forms a MOS device in Athena using a salicide process 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Uses assigned variables to parameterize the structure
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulates Id/Vgs-Vbs curves in Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulates Id/Vds-Vgs curves in Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interfaces to UTMOST for extraction of a BSIM3 parameter set.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The process simulation used for this example is an NMOS process flow.
Further description of MOS process simulation can be found in the MOS
examples description.  As a more advanced technique, this flow has been
parameterized in places using the
<b> set </b> statements. These are used to assign variables such as spacer width
which are then used later in several locations in the input file.
<b> extract </b> statements are used throughout the process simulation to measure
important process parameters. In terms of the SPICE model extraction, it
is vital to extract the gate oxide thickness in metres for use in
UTMOST.
</p>
<p>
The salicide process to create self-aligned silicides on the source,
drain and gate requires the use of the Athena/SILICIDES module. Users
who do not have this option could replace the silicidation steps with
metal deposition and patterning as used in the previous MOS examples.
In this transistor, titanium silicide is used. A titanium layer is
deposited and a short heat cycle applied. No special method parameters
are needed to enable creation of the silicide layer during this
diffusion. The remaining titanium is then stripped. These silicide
regions are indicated in the
<b> electrode </b> definition in Athena.
</p>
<p>
The two Atlas runs in this example are also parameterized using the
<b> set </b> statement. This enables easy conversion of the whole Id/Vgs and Id/Vds
tests from, say, NMOS to PMOS or 5.0V supply to 3.3V.
</p>
<p>
The first Atlas run simulates Id/Vgs curves at three substrate biases. The sequence of
<b> solve </b> statements is to first save three solutions at each back bias with Vds=0.1V and Vgs=0.0V.
Each of these three files is then loaded in turn using
<b> load </b> and the gate voltage ramped up to the supply voltage defined as &apos;vdsmax&apos;.
In this example all three curves are saved to a single log file.
However it is more traditional to save the three curves in separate
files. Either approach is possible.
</p>
<p>
The second Atlas run simulates Id/Vds curves at three different gate
voltages. A similar technique to the first run is used. Three solution
files are saved at each gate bias with Vds=0.0V. These are then loaded
in turn and the drain voltage ramped to &apos;vdsmax&apos;. All the curves are
saved to a single log file although separate ones could be used for
each curve.
</p>
<p>
The final stage of the example is to run UTMOST to extract the SPICE
model. Important information about the structure such as gate oxide
thickness and gate length is transferred to UTMOST using the results of
<b> extract </b> statements in the Athena simulation. The log files from Atlas are
loaded and appended together. UTMOST then fits the SPICE model to the
complete Id/Vgs-Vbs and Id/Vds-Vgs data sets. All the UTMOST parameters
are stored to a file and then extract is used to print out the
parameters of interest.
