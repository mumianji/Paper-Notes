This example shows the dramatic effect of depletion in the poly gate when the
doping in the poly is reduced below its maximum level.  The I-V curves show
that even a doping density of 1e20/cm3 in the poly is not sufficient to
prevent depletion, loss of current drive and a shift in the threshold voltage
of the n-MOSFET.
</p>
<p>
The first indication of poly depletion is non ideal C-V curves as shown in the
previous &quot;Poly Depletion&quot; example.  Reduced doping in the poly gate can be a
combination of insufficient implant dose, counter doping of P+ poly and dopant
evapouration during uncapped anneals.
</p>
<p>
The program runs three identical simulations the only difference being the
doping in the poly gate.  Three doping levels are simulated, 1e19, 1e20 and
1e21/cm3.  At the end of the three simulations, the I-V curves of the n-MOSFET
in the region of the threshold voltage are plotted.  The effect of poly doping
is demonstrated by the increased threshold voltage and reduced current drive
with reduced poly doping.
