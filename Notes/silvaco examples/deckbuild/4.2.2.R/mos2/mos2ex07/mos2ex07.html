This example demonstrates the curve tracing algorithm in Atlas to
simulate  the snapback of a MOSFET. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Creation of a N-channel MOSFET in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Remesh by DEVEDIT,
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 The Atlas curve tracing algorithm is used to trace MOS snapback.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
A standard NMOS device is constructed, remeshed and loaded into Atlas.
The process simulation, interface to DEVEDIT and initial setup in Atlas
are described in the previous section under MOS examples.
</p>
<p>
The initial syntax in Atlas sets all the required contact, interface
and model setting used for MOS simulation. These settings are described
in earlier example descriptions. Calculation of  impact ionization is
necessary for breakdown and snapback simulation. The
<b> impact </b> statement is used to activate the Selberherr impact ionization model.
</p>
<p>
Curve tracing is an algorithm for choosing the boundary conditions for
a simulation to trace out an IV curve. It is typically used on curves
such as snapback or latchup with many turning points.
</p>
<p>
For curve tracing simulations the key statement is :
<b> curvetrace end.val=1.e-3 contr.name=drain curr.cont mincur=1e-10 nextst.ratio=1.3.</b> It is used to initialize parameters for the curve tracing algorithm. The
<b>contr.name </b> parameter specifies the name of electrode for which the load line
technique will be applied. Here this is the &apos;drain&apos;. The
<b>curr.cont </b> parameter sets
that value of current will be monitored. The simulation will stop when
the current exceeds the value specified by
<b>end.val </b> parameter.
The
<b>mincur </b> parameter defines the minimum current value after which the load
line technique will be actually be applied. Before that, pure voltage boundary
conditions are used. The
<b>nextst.ratio </b> parameter defines the factor which is
used to increase voltage step on parts of the IV curve away from the turning
points. The main place this is used is in the pre-breakdown voltage ramp.
<b> solve curvetrace </b> is used to activate the curve tracing algorithm.
</p>
<p>
The final snapback curve can be plotted using TonyPlot. To plot the drain
voltage actually applied to the device, the x-axis should be set to
<b> drain int. bias</b> and not drain bias. &apos;drain int. bias&apos; is the voltage on the
drain contact/semiconductor interface. The value of drain bias should be
disregarded since it includes the effect of the load line algorithm
used for the curve trace.
