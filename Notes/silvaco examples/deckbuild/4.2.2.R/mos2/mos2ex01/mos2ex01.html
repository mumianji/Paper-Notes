This example uses the MixedMode module in Atlas to simulate the circuit
performance of two NMOS inverters in series. The first inverter is
simulated using Atlas, the second inverter using SPICE level 1 models.
This simulation shows how to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Create an NMOS structure using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Calculate the initial DC state in circuit mode
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulate the DC transfer curve of the inverters.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Simulate the transient switching curve of the inverters.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The input file consists of four separate runs, each starting with the statement
<b> go atlas. </b> The first one uses the Atlas syntax to construct an NMOS transistor.
The mesh, regions and electrodes are specified as coordinates in the
syntax. It is compulsory to use electrode names (and not just numbers)
when the structure is used in MixedMode. The doping distribution for
the device is constructed from several gaussian and uniform analytical
functions. The final structure is saved for later use.
</p>
<p>
The second run calculates the initial operating point of the circuit.
The syntax for this run is split into two parts. The first is a
SPICE-like circuit description and control cards. This part is bounded by
<b> .begin </b> and
<b> .end</b> . The second is device
parameter syntax. The circuit netlist is written using standard SPICE
syntax. This example has two inverters composed of an NMOS transistor
and resistor connected in series feeding into a capacitor.
</p>
<p>
The two NMOS transistors are defined is different ways. The first labeled
<b> an </b> is to be simulated in Atlas. The syntax specifies the structure file
name from the previous run, and also connects the circuit nodes to
electrode names. The other NMOS transistor labeled &apos;mn&apos; is simulated
using using SPICE level 1 model labeled &apos;simple&apos;.
</p>
<p>
After the .end statement the device parameter syntax is given. This
sets the models, material and contact parameters for the Atlas device.
</p>
<p>
The second run solves a single DC operating point as the initial guess
to the third run. The third run uses the command
<b> .dc </b> to set a DC ramp of the input voltage &apos;vin&apos; from zero to 5.0V in 0.25V
steps. The currents and voltages for each node are stored in the file
specified in the
<b> .log </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
The final run uses the
<b> .tran </b> statement combined with a time dependent definition of &apos;vin&apos; using the
PULSE parameter to set up a switching transient. The PULSE syntax
specifies that the pulse of &apos;vin&apos; has a peak value of 5.0V, a rise and
fall time of 50ps, and a time at peak value of 1ns. On the .tran
statement, 1ps specifies the initial timestep only. All other timesteps
are automatically calculated by Atlas. This differs from the .tran card
in standalone SPICE programs. The maximum simulation time is set to 3ns.
