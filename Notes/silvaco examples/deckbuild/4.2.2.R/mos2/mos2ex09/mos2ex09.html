This example demonstrates the extraction of the gate overlap capacitance
for an LDD MOSFET structure. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Construction of an LDD MOSFET in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Regrid of the structure in DEVEDIT
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Gate/drain overlap capacitance extraction using AC analysis
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
A LDD NMOS  device is constructed, remeshed and loaded into Atlas.
The process simulation, interface to DEVEDIT and initial setup in Atlas
are described in the previous section under MOS examples.
</p>
<p>
One requirement for AC simulation is that a two carrier solution must be specified.  This is set with
<b> method carriers=2</b> .  After the initial
solution, a solution at a gate bias of -2 volts is obtained using the
local initial guess. The local method is convenient when taking large
voltage steps, but it assumes no current flow.
</p>
<p>
Next, the
<b> log </b> statement is used to specify a file for saving the results of the
gate ramp.  Then, the gate is swept from -2 volts to 2 volts in 0.2
volt increments.  At each static solution of gate bias the small
signal AC response is solved at a frequency of 1 MHz.  These results
are saved in the log file.  Finally the overlap capacitance as a function
of gate bias is plotted using TonyPlot. In the list of XY graph variables
in the TonyPlot DISPLAY menu, the capacitances and conductances are listed as:
<b> C electrode_name_1 &gt; electrode_name_2</b> . This means the capacitance between these two electrodes. A similar
construction is used with &apos;G&apos; for conductance between two electrodes.
When the two electrode names are the same, the magnitude of this value
is the total capacitance on this electrode.
