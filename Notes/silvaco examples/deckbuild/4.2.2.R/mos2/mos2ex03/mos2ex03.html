This example demonstrates the transient simulation of a MOS transistor including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Formation of a MOS structure in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Interface from Athena to Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Specification of external RC elements to make an NMOS inverter
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Transient simulation of gate turn-on
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The process simulation follows a standard LDD MOS process. Further
description of the MOS process simulation and the Athena to Atlas
interface can be found in the description of the MOS examples.
</p>
<p>
In Atlas the first task is setting the gate workfunction using the
<b> contact </b> statement and interface charge using the
<b> interface </b> statement.  The models used for this simulation are selected using the macro
<b> mos</b> . This model set uses the CVT mobility model and SRH recombination. A
two-carrier solution is also specified on the models statement.
Two-carrier solutions are necessary for transients and when external
passive elements are used irrespective of the type of device being
simulated.
</p>
<p>
The second
<b> contact </b> statement is used to set the external resistance and capacitance on the
drain electrode. A resistance of 1.0e5 ohms.um is used to correspond to
a load resistor in a memory cell. A capacitance of 0.5pF/um is
specified to emulate the gates and interconnect the drain must drive.
These external elements emulate the formation of an NMOS inverter in
SPISCES. This contrasts with the previously described example using
MixedMode.
</p>
<p>
The initial state of the device is set at 5.0V on the drain. The
<b> local </b> initial guess method is used to allow large change in the drain bias in
a single step. This local method will only converge if the change in
current caused by the voltage step is small. This is true here
since the gate voltage is zero.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> solve </b> statement for the transient simulation contains the final gate voltage,
the ramptime of the gate voltage, the initial timestep and the final
simulation time. Only the initial timestep is specified in the solve
statement. All other timestep sizes are calculated by Atlas based on
the local truncation error in the solution.
