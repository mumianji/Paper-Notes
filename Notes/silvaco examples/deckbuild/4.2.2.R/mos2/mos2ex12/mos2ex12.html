This example demonstrates the interface from process to device
simulation for a SiGe PMOS structure. Physical deposition and etch
models are used to provide realistic topography. It shows:

In this example a SiGe MOSFET structure is formed using process
simulation. This contrasts with the previous examples in this section.
To repeat the electrical analysis of the previous examples using this
structure the Atlas simulation of this example should be replaced with
the Atlas syntax for parameter settings, model selection, numerical
methods and solve sequences from the previous examples.
</p>
<p>
The simulation of SiGe structures in Athena is similar to pure silicon
MOSFET structures documented under the MOS examples section. The
differences described here are limited to the special syntax needed for
SiGe.
</p>
<p>
The Ge mole fraction in the deposited SiGe film is set by the
<b> c.frac </b> parameter on the deposit statement.
</p>
<p>
In FLASH it is necessary to define whether a dopant is donor or acceptor
explicitly for each material. The command
<b> impurity i.boron acceptor sige </b> is used to set boron as a p-type dopant in SiGe. A similar command is
used to define phosphorus as a  donor.
</p>
<p>
The interface from Athena to Atlas is the simple
<b> go atlas </b> statement. It saves the structure from Athena and transfers it to Atlas. No
<b> mesh </b> statement is needed at the start of the Atlas run. The
<b> electrode </b> statement in Athena is required to identify which regions are defined
as electrodes in Atlas.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas run in this file is very simple. It solves only a single bias
point with Vds=2.0V. To save the band structure the command
<b> output con.band val.band </b> is used. This tells Atlas to save the conduction and valence band edge
energies to any solution files saved using
<b> save</b> . The final structure in Atlas is displayed using TonyPlot. The band
diagram can be seen by taking a vertical 1D cross section in TonyPlot,
selecting the 1D plot and changing the display variables from the
scrolling list to be the two band edges.
