THe example demonstrates a comparison between three different surface
mobility models used in MOSFETs. THe example consists of four Atlas runs that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Define optimum MOS mesh using a variable for surface mesh spacing
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Select in turn one of three MOS Mobility Models
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Run a Id/Vgs simulation at low Vds
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Overlay of Id/Vgs curves and mobility in Tonyplot
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The mesh generation and structure deinfition part of this input file
follows the standard syntax outlined in the Getting Started Chapter of
the Atlas manual. A variable
<b> surf_a </b> is used to set the mesh spacing at the silicon surface. This mesh
spacing is important in resolving the high electric field and carrier
concentration gradients at the surface. The sensitivity of the mobility
models to mesh variations can also be easily examined by re-running
this example with different settings of surf_a.
</p>
<p>
The three models compared in this example are
<i> CVT, Shirahata </i> and
<i> Modified Watt</i> . The CVT model is selectred simply with the syntax
<b> models cvt </b> since it contains doping and parallel field dependence. The Shirahata
model contains only a perpendicular field dependence. It must be
combined with Klaassen&apos;s model and the standard field dependent
mobility model using
<b> models kla shi fldmob</b> .
</p>
<p>
The modified Watt model also needs to be combined with other models. The syntax is:
<br/>
<b> models conmob fldmob  </b> <br/>
<b> mobility watt.n mod.watt.n </b> </p>
<p>
Extra parameters are also required to determine the range of the modified Watt model. These parameters are
<b> ymaxn.watt </b> that specifies the depth of the Watt model and
<b> min.surf </b> that specifies the lateral extent by restricting the model to minority
regions. In this case this means the channel and not the LDD or source and
drain regions.
</p>
<p>
The Id/Vgs simulation is similar to that in the previous section. For the
initial drain biasing, the syntax
<b> method gummel newton </b> is used. This provides better convergence at low biases.
The simulation reverts to
<b> method newton </b> once the drain is biased.
Note that in this case only electrons are needed. The syntax
<b> method carriers=1 electrons </b> is used to specify that only electron continuity and poisson equations are to
be solved.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> probe </b> statement is used to save the surface mobility and perpendicular field at the
center of the channel. Values for both these parameters are saved to the
<i> log </i> file. TonyPlot can be used to display graphs of mobility vs. field.
Note that the probe statement reports the exact mobility used in Atlas
calculations. The value is calculated at the centre of the side of each
triangle. The nearest such point to the location of the probe is used.
Values of mobility or field from the probe might differ from values saved
in the
<i> solution file</i> . The solution file saves the average value of such quantities at a node
point. With coarse or bad meshes, this may result in inaccurate plots.
