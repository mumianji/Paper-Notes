This examples uses a standard NMOS structure similar to that used in
the MOS1 section. In this example the Atlas simulation is performed using
<b> zero carriers</b> . The breakdown voltage is extracted using
<b> ionization integrals </b> or
<b> electric field lines </b> </p>
<p>
The
<b> solve </b> statement used to ramp the drain electrode has extra parameters for
calculating the ionization integrals at each step. When using
ionization integrals it is not necessary to solve for both carriers so
simulations are very fast. However, the statement
<b> impact selb </b> must be used to activate the ionization rate calculation.
</p>
<p>
The syntax of the solve statement sets the number of ionization
integrals, their position relative to the ramped contact (ie. drain),
and the voltage drop from the contact to the start point of the
electric field lines. Details of the syntax can be found in the Atlas
User Manual.
<b> deltav </b> controls the distance of the start of each electric field line from the
ramped contact.
<b> ionlines </b> controls the number of electric field lines calculated.
<b> lratio </b> controls the spacing ratio between each line. Lratio &lt; 1.0 means more
lines to the left of the contact. Lratio &gt; 1.0 means more lines to the
right.
</p>
<p>
The breakdown voltage is defined as the point at which the ionization integrals are equal to 1.0. Although the
<b> solve</b> statement specifies a voltage ramp to 50V, the bias ramp will
automatically  stop when the ionization integrals exceed 1.0. The
parameter
<b> ^ionstop </b> can be included to disable this feature. If the position of the electric
field lines are chosen correctly the electron and hole ionization integrals
should equal 1.0 at the same voltage. If this is not the case, users should
check the position of the electric field lines.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> output </b> statement is used to specify the electric field line parameters for the
saved solution file. Note that users must specify these parameters on
the output as well as solve statements to save the electric field
lines. The lines can be plotted in Tonyplot by selecting the LINES icon
from the PLOT/DISPLAY menu.
</p>
<p>
Following the simulation, the peak electric field is extracted from the
solution file. The
<b> extract </b> statement also reports the XY position of the peak. See the Simulation
Standard Hints and Tips page for August 1996 for more details.
