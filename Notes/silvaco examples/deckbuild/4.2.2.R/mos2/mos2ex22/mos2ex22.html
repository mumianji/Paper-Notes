This example shows how to generate a
<b> paper Spice model card, </b> from a device that has not yet been created, but has only been simulated in
TCAD.  Once the deckbuild input file has been created, the entire flow can be
run, without operator intervention, in the deckbuild environment.
</p>
<p>
The example flow creates a 3D 65nm nMOS transistor using Victory Process, then
simulates unsaturated and saturated threshold voltage curves and an IdVd curve
set, using Victory Device.  These curves are then used as input to the Spice
Model extraction and optimization tool, called UTMOST-IV.
</p>
<p>
The UTMOST-IV section begins with the
<b> go utmost4</b> line, and the entire script from the
<b> script begin</b> line to the
<b> script end</b> line is passed to the UTMOST-IV simulator.  The
<b> run script</b> line then informs UTMOST-IV to run the passed script.  Deckbuild will not
continue on to the next lines, until the script is completed by UTMOST-IV.
</p>
<p>
The first few lines begining with
<b> var</b> declares variables that will be modified later.  This variable declaration is
not strictly necessary, but is good practice and is strongly advised.
</p>
<p>
The next two blocks of the input file load and format the unsaturated and
saturated threshold voltage log files generated from the TCAD simulations.
</p>
<p>
The third block of the input file creates a &quot;for&quot; loop to load in the four
IdVd TACD log file curves.  The variable &quot;i&quot; is used to index the log file
number included at the end of each of the separate TCAD log file base names.
Once all these TCAD data quantity names and data formats have been defined,
the whole data set is saved using the
<b> saveDataSets</b> parameter, which creates the
<b> mos2ex22.uds</b> file, which will be used as the curve reference data in the Spice model card
optimization routine.
</p>
<p>
Currently in UTMOST-IV, there is still one project file that needs to be
created in the UTMOST-IV interactive GUI, before UTMOST-IV input files can be
run in the deckbuild run time environment.  This is the
<b> mos2ex22.prj</b> file, which has already been created for you, so there is no need to open the
UTMOST-IV GUI to run this example.  It is envisioned that in a future version
of UTMOST-IV, it will be possible to also create this project file within the
deckbuild script, allowing complete optimization input files to be created
within the deckbuild environment.
</p>
<p>
The optimization process involves loading a default Spice Model, setting some
base device characteristics in the Spice model card, such as gate oxide
thickness, length and width etc., that match thre TCAD device, defining the
device test Spice netlist for running I-V curves, loading the reference TCAD
I-V curves for optimization, and then running the optimization routine to
modify the Spice model card parameters, such that the generated Spice model
then fits the characteristics of the TCAD simulations.
</p>
<p>
Once the model optimization and extraction is complete, the new Spice model
generated curves are compared with the TCAD generated curves, so that the
accuracy of the optimization can be visualized.  In the generated plots,  the
filenames containing the letters &quot;ut&quot; are those generated by UTMOST which
created the new Spice model card device parameters.  The other curves are
generated from TCAD simulations.

To load and run this example, select the
<b> Load</b> button in DeckBuild &gt; Examples. This will copy the input file and any support files to your current working directory. Select the
<b> Run</b> button in DeckBuild to execute the example.
