This example is similar to mosex18 but uses a different degradation model.
It demonstrates :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Using Athena to set up a pMOSFET.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Setting up a deck with with the Reaction-Diffusion degradation model enabled.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Doing stressing and relaxation biasing transient simulations.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Using PROBE statement to get hydrogen densities.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Obtaining Id-Vg curves for degraded device structures.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The first section beginning
<br/>
<b> go athena</b> <br/>
is much the same as mos2ex18.  The next section starting
<br/>
<b> go atlas</b> <br/>
enables the reaction-diffusion model using the DEVDEG.RD parameter
<br/>
<b> model temp=300 mos hhi devdeg.rd devdeg.h</b> <br/>
and the parameter DEVDEG.H specifies that the traps created will become positively charged.
The hot hole model is also enabled.  Accompanying the models statement is
<br/>
<b> degradation rd.sihtot=1.0e12 rd.h.hccoef=1.0e8 rd.kf0=2.0e-4 rd.aevar=0.05 rd.kr0=1.0e-13 rd.invhcoef=0.01 rd.coupled</b> <br/>
which sets the density of passivated bonds on the interface using the RD.SIHTOT parameter.  The contribution of hot holes
to the degradation is included by assigning a value to the RD.H.HCCOEF parameter.  The depassivation rate constant RD.KF0
is set to 2.0e-4 /s and the repassivation rate constant to 1e-13 cc /s.  The default activation energy of 1.5 eV is
used with a variance of 0.05 eV as specified by the RD.AEVAR parameter.  The RD.INVHCOEF parameter enables the inversion
hole contribution to depassivation rate, and the RD.COUPLED flag enables fully self-consistent coupling between the
hydrogen generation rates and the other equations.
</p>
<p>
The PROBE statements probe the atomic hydrogen and molecular hydrogen compositions at various points near to the
Si/SiO2 interface.
</p>
<p>
The device is stressed to -2.0 V on the gate and 0.1 V on the drain and the simulation run
for 100 s.  The DEVDEG parameter on the LOG statement means that the total interface charge due to
degradation is stored in the log file.  The depassivation process creates atomic hydrogen which
then diffuses and dimerises to molecular hydrogen.  The default values for diffusion and dimerisation
have been used,  details are given in the manual.
</p>
<p>
In the next section, starting
<br/>
<b> go atlas</b> <br/>
the same models are set and the device structure degraded to 100 s is read in using the LOAD statement.
The gate and drain biases are zeroed on a short ramp and the device is relaxed to 1000 s. The presence
of atomic hydrogen which has not diffused away from the interface means that the repassivation rate is
greater than the depassivation rate, most notably in the channel under the gate. This is seen in the
integrated degradation charge which is captured in the log file and is plotted at the end of the relaxation
simulation.
</p>
<p>
The structure files from this and the previous section are all saved with the DEVDEG parameter on the OUTPUT
statement causing the degradation trap density to be output.  This is then used in the final section, starting
<br/>
<b> go atlas</b> <br/>
where each of the saved structure files is read in turn during the loop statement, and the Id-Vg curves
obtained. These are then plotted and you can see that the relaxed structure has retained a small shift in
threshold voltage.  This is disproportionate to the overall reduction in interface charge density, and is
due to the large repassivation occuring at the interface under the gate,  where the device is most sensitive
to interface charge.  Over longer time periods the free hydrogen will diffuse away and repassivation will cease.
