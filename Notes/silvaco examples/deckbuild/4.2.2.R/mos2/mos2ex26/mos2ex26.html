<p>
For devices with a gate length of 28nm and below, it is possible to obtain
significant mobile carrier mobility enhancement for most of the channel length,
using remotely located epitaxial stressor material in the source drain regions.
Using mobility enhancement techniques like this for p-channel devices can
reduce the need for wider gate widths to match complimentary n-channel current
drives, allowing the possibility of truely symmetrical layouts for
complimentary MOS designs.
</p>
<p>
In this example, we show the effects of mobility enhancement using epitaxially
grown SiGe source-drain regions in a 7nm p-channel FinFET.  The stress
calculation is invoked during the process simulation with the
<b> Stress exposed</b> statement line.  This calculates the stress induced by the SiGe epitaxial
source-drain regions.  At the end of the process simulation, any additional
stress induced by subsequent processing steps is adjusted for by the
<b> Stress exposed rebalance</b> line.  The stress calculations are saved into the final structure file, which
is then exported to Victory Device.  The strain induced mobility enhancement is
calculated in the
<b> mobility material=silicon model.iso=1 nhance phance</b> line.  These enhanced mobility values are then included into any subsequent
mobility model.
</p>
<p>
The first device simulation calculates the un-saturate IdVg curve without
invoking the strain enhancement calculations, whilst the second device
simulation takes strain into account.  The difference due to the strain
enhanced mpobility is shown in the final plot.
