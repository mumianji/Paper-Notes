This example demonstrates fabrication and second breakdown analysis of
a short channel structure with non-isothermal energy balance models.

Deep submicron devices should be simulated using the Energy Balance Model
due to velocity overshoot, and nonlocal impact ionization effects,
which could substantially influence device characteristics.  For high
current levels, the thermal self-heating effects can also play an
important role by decreasing mobility and impact ionization rate. This
example demonstrates second breakdown simulation with the non-isothermal
energy balance model using curve tracing algorithm.
</p>
<p>
A fully coupled approach is used to solve five equations in this
device. This provides much improved convergence over decoupled
techniques used in older Atlas versions.
</p>
<p>
The workfunction, interface charge and MOS models are set using the syntax as described in earlier examples. The
energy balance equation for electrons and lattice energy balance
equation  are set by
<b> models hcte.el lat.temp</b> . The
<b> impact </b> statement is used to assign the energy relaxation length for Selberherr
model.  Thermal boundary conditions are required with any
non-isothermal simulation. These are defined in the
<b> thermcontact </b> statement.  A value of the thermal conductance is specified at the
thermal contact located along the substrate. Thermal isolation
conditions are assumed on the all other surfaces.
</p>
<p>
The
<b> curvetrace </b> statement is used to initialize parameters for curve tracing algorithm. A full description of the curve tracing syntax is included with the MOS snapback example.
The gate voltage is ramped to 1V, and then the
<b> solve curvetrace </b> statement is used to activate the curve tracing algorithm.
</p>
<p>
Plotting the internal drain bias versus drain current in TonyPlot will
display the second breakdown curve.  The resulting curve from Atlas
shows several turning points. The second breakdown occurs at the final
stage where the voltage drops sharply. At this point both the lattice
and carrier temperatures are high.
