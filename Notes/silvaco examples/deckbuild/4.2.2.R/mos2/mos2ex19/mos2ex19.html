This example shows how to simulate the finite charging and discharging times of
interface traps without doing a transient simulation.
The example demonstrates:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 How to use the sweep and save parameters of dbinternal.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Set up a deck with interface traps extending into the oxide.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Do a steady-state voltage ramp while simulating the temporal response of traps.
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Obtain and visualise the threshold voltage differences as a function of simulated ramp time.
<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The file mos2ex19.in starts dbinternal and instructs it to
use mos2ex19_aux.in.  The statement
<br/>
<b> sweep parameter=measurementtime type=power range=&quot;1.0, 1.0e-4, 9&quot; </b> <br/>
causes the deck to be run 9 times in succession with the value of measurement time
varying between 1.0 and 1.0e-4 in a semi-decade decrease each time.  The file
mos2ex19_aux.in sets up a basic nMOSFET, and the statement
<br/>
<b> inttrap e.level=0.6 acceptor density=1.0e12 s.i degen=4 sign=1.0e-13 sigp=1.0e-14 x.min=0.6 x.max=0.9 heiman depth=0.002 hpoints=20 </b> <br/>
sets up a uniform distribution of acceptor-like traps along part of the Si/SiO2 interface. The areal density is
1e12 /cc and the depth is 0.6 eV below the Silicon conduction band.  The HEIMAN flag causes the traps
to have a uniform distribution into the interface to a depth of 2 nanometres, covered by a vertical interpolation
mesh of 20 points.  How this affects the capture and emission times of the carriers is explained in the
manual.
The solve statement parameter
<b> timespan </b> is assigned a value from the current value of measurementtime, and supplies the
overall time for the ramp to the HEIMAN model. The drain is biased to conduct and then the
gate voltage is ramped from 0V to 3V. The trap occupancy is then calculated
at each bias step according to the bias value and the elapsed time.  At the end of the
forward ramp, the gate voltage is ramped down to 0 V again, with the same value assigned
to timespan.
</p>
<p>
The threshold voltages and their difference are calculated and are output to the file
mos2ex19.dat in a format suitable for viewing by Tonyplot. This was specified in the
statement
<br/>
<b> save type=sdb outfile=mos2ex19.dat</b> <br/>
in mos2ex19.in.  The log files for forward and reverse gate bias ramps are also
output, and the ones plotted correspond to the last value of measurement time used
(0.1 milliseconds).
</p>
<p>
The traps are initially empty and as the bias increases they start to fill with electrons.
For a short measurement time the traps occupation fraction is small when the threshold gate
voltage is exceeded and so there is no significant effect on the threhold voltage.  At the
end of the ramp the trap occupation is higher.  A solve prev at this stage would cause the
trap occupation probabilities to achieve their steady state values.  Instead, the gate voltage
ramp is reversed and the traps continue to charge until the gate voltage is reduced enough
that carrier emission starts to dominate.  The threshold voltage occurs while the traps still
have a high occupation probability and contibute a negative interface charge.  Consequently
the threshold voltage is higher on the reverse ramp.  This difference is plotted as a
function of measurement time, and is more pronounced for shorter simulated measurement
times. For longer measurement times the traps have time to respond to the bias changes and
no hysteresis effects are seen.  Typical Id-Vg curves and trap occupation probabilities versus Vg
curves are shown for a measurement time of 0.1 milliseconds. They clearly demonstrate the
hysteresis.  Actual Vt values can also be plotted from mos2ex19.dat.
