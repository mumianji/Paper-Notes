This is a demonstration of the hot carrier reliability feature of Atlas. A PMOS transistor is stressed at high voltages and a threshold voltage shift observed.
The simulation shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Formation of PMOS transistor using Atlas syntax
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vgs test 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 High voltage stress for 1000 seconds
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
 Id/Vgs tests of devices at various stress times.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The example file consists of five separate Atlas runs each starting
with the statement
<b> go atlas</b> . The first run uses the Atlas syntax to construct the geometry, mesh
and doping of a PMOS transistor. The doping is specified using gaussian
functions. The mesh file saved by this run is loaded into the next run.
</p>
<p>
The second Atlas run sets commands to perform an Id/Vgs simulation to
observe the threshold voltage and gain. A more complete description of
extracting PMOS threshold can be found in the MOS examples section.
</p>
<p>
The device degradation modeling is performed in the third run. First, the
structure is loaded and the correct workfunction and interface fixed
charge are set. On the models statement, the standard mobility and
recombination models are specified. The parameters
<b> hei devdeg.e </b> are also set. hei turns on the hot electron injection model for gate
current. The devdeg.e parameter sets that the gate current is used to
calculate device degradation. The
<b> degradation </b> parameter is used to specify the interface state density and the
electron trapping cross section, sigmae. The density of interface
states as a function of position is defined here using a C-INTERPRETER
routine. The external file
<b> mos2ex02_devdeg.nta </b> is used in this example. This file will be copied to your current
working directory if you press &apos;Load&apos;. This file contains a C
language description of the density of acceptor-like traps at the
oxide/silicon interface. Use of the C-INTERPRETER allows complete
flexibility in specifying the position of the traps.
</p>
<p>
The stressing conditions are Vds=-6.0V and Vgs=-1.5V. The device is
biased to these voltages in DC mode. Atlas is then switched to a
transient solution. Since the time of this transient is very long
compared with the transit time of carriers a faster transient solution
method can be selected using
<b> method quasistatic</b> .
</p>
<p>
The transient simulation is set to run for 1000s. At various intervals, data is
saved to solution files whose prefix is set to &apos;mosex02.str&apos;. The
statement
<b> output devdeg </b> is required to save the interface trap occupancy to these solution
files. These files will be the initial starting points of the
subsequent Id/Vgs runs.
</p>
<p>
The fourth and fifth runs are just repetitions of the second one. They
perform the Id/Vgs test to observe threshold voltage and gain. However
the important difference is the the file loaded in the
<b> mesh </b> statement is the output files saved during the transient stress.
</p>
<p>
The Id/Vgs curves from the second, fourth and fifth runs can be
overlaid in TonyPlot to show the threshold voltage shift caused by the
hot carriers trapped at the interface.
