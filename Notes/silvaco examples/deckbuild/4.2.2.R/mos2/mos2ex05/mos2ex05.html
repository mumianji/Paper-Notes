This example demonstrates fabrication and Id/Vds analysis of a short
channel structure with Energy Balance and Non-isothermal Energy Balance
Models. The example shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Creation of a  short channel MOSFET in Athena
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
  Regridding in DEVEDIT 
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
  Isothermal Id/Vds analysis in Atlas
<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
  Non-isothermal Id/Vds analysis in Atlas
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Deep submicron devices should be simulated using the Energy Balance Model
due to velocity overshoot and nonlocal impact ionization effects,
which could substantially influence device characteristics. For high
current levels (high gate voltages) the thermal self-heating effects
can also play an important role by decreasing mobility and the impact
ionization rate. This example demonstrates a comparison of Id/Vds curves
obtained between the Energy Balance and Nonisothermal Energy Balance Models.
</p>
<p>
The structure is formed using a standard LDD NMOS process and
regridding is performed in DEVEDIT to refine the mesh in the areas
where high electric fields will occur in Atlas. This procedure is
described under the Substrate and Gate current example in the MOS
example section.
</p>
<p>
There are two Atlas runs in this example file.  The first Atlas run
uses Energy Balance Model, and the second run uses both the energy
balance and heat flow equations.
</p>
<p>
In both runs the
<b> material </b> statement is used to assign an energy relaxation time for electrons.
The
<b> models </b> statement is used to select a set of physical models for this simulation.  In this case,
these models are CONSRH and AUGER recombination, the CVT mobility model,
Band Gap Narrowing, two carriers model (carriers=2), and the energy balance equation
for electrons only (hcte.el).
The
<b> impact </b> statement is used to assign the energy relaxation length for the Selberherr model.
The
<b> contact </b> statement is used to assign the work function on the polysilicon gate.
</p>
<p>
The gate voltage is ramped to 3V. At this stage, a combined algorithm is used by specifying
<b> method gummel newton</b> . This means that if convergence is not reached in decoupled (or gummel)
mode, the simulator will automatically switch to coupled (or newton)
mode .  The the drain voltage is then ramped. The combined algorithm is
typically used for low and moderate drain biases, and newton alone for high
drain biases.
</p>
<p>
The drain voltage is ramped to show the Id/Vds curves obtained up to
8V. This demonstrates the convergence improvements possible by using a
fully coupled solution for energy balance simulation. A decoupled
solution generally would not converge at higher drain biases.
</p>
<p>
In the second Atlas run, the same set of models is used, except that
the solution of the  lattice energy balance equation is activated using
<b> models lat.temp</b> .
</p>
<p>
As with all lattice heat flow simulation, thermal boundary conditions must be defined.
Thermal boundary conditions are defined in the
<b> thermcontact </b> statement.  A value of the thermal conductance is specified at the
thermal contact located along the substrate, whilst thermal isolation
conditions are assumed on the all other surfaces.
</p>
<p>
The final Id/Vds curves can be compared and overlaid using TonyPlot.
