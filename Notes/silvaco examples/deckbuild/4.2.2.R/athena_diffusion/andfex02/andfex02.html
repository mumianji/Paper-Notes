This example demonstrates the diffusion models for Oxidation
Enhanced Diffusion (OED).
When diffusion is performed in an
oxidizing ambient, point defects are injected into the silicon with a
rate that is a function of the rate at which the silicon is oxidizing.
This point defect injection gives rise to an increased diffusion that
is commonly referred to as OED.
</p>
<p>
To model OED the
<b> TWO.DIM </b> diffusion model must specified
on the
<b> METHOD </b> statement.  When this model is specified, the
interstitial and vacancy concentration will be calculated along with
the impurities.  This model loosely couples the point defects,
generated by the oxidizing Si-SiO2 interface, with the diffusing
boron.
</p>
<p>
When modeling point defects it is necessary to extend the substrate of
the simulation space to provide an adequate sink for the point defects.
Simulations show that a depth of 20 to 50 microns is required in most
cases.
</p>
<p>
This example re-runs the simulation using the
<b> fermi </b> model to compare results. The overlay plot at the end of the simulation
demonstrates the extra oxidation enhancement to the diffusion depth.
