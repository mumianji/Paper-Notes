This example demonstrates the high dose extensions to the fully coupled
diffusion model from Stanford.
</p>
<p>
This model results from the work of Scott Crowder and Peter Griffin at
Stanford and represents an extended fully coupled diffusion model
accounting for dopant-defect coupling, seen at high concentrations.
</p>
<p>
The model is invoked by selecting the following method flag:
<b> method high.conc.</b> </p>
<p>
This model extends the previous fully coupled model (full.cpl) to
include extra reactions terms related to the pairing of dopant and
point defect states. Further, it includes extra reactions describing
coupled recombination terms in both the bulk and at the surface.
</p>
<p>
The parameter:
</p>
<b> ivfactor </b> <p>
controls the relative rate of PD recombination based upon vacancy-dopant pairs recombining with free interstitials with respect to straight interstitial - vacancy recombination. This parameter may be physically considered as a capture cross section ratio.
</p>
<p>
Similarly,
<b> iifactor </b> controls the relative rate of PD recombination based upon interstitial-dopant pairs recombining with free vacancies with respect to straight interstitial - vacancy recombination. This parameter may be physically considered as a capture cross section ratio.
</p>
<p>
Also related only to the surface,
<b> Isurfact </b> is the ratio of the
surface capture cross sections of V-PI surface recombination and I-V
surface recombination.
</p>
<p>
This model is thought to be significant when dealing with unclustered
concentrations above 1e19 /cm^3.
