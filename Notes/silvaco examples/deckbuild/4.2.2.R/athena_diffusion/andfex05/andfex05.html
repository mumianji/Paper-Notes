This example demonstrates the effect of Phosphorus pile-up during oxidation.
To clearly demonstrate the pile-up effect the example starts with constant P concentration of 1e18 /cm^3. The effect is most pronounced when oxidation is more intensive than diffusion, so phosphorus piling-up due to moving oxidation front does not have time to diffuse inside the bulk. High pressure is used to increase oxidation rate.
If the standard
<b> Fermi </b> model for diffusion is used, the pile-up effect is
exaggerated because oxidation enhanced diffusion is not taken into account.
More realistic profiles can be obtained using the
<b> Two.dim </b> model. In this case phosphorus diffuses faster inside the bulk which prevents the formation of a very high pile-up.
