This example demonstrates the use of the transient activation model.
This model simulates the activation of dopants after ion implantation.
The model is invoked by the parameter
</p>
<b> CLUST.TRANS </b> <p>
in the
<b> METHOD </b> statement.
</p>
<p>
Experiments show that only a small portion (~10-20%) of implanted atoms is activated immediately in the beginning of the annealing process. It takes some
time for impurities to achieve equilibrium active concentration level which
usually corresponds to solid solubility.  On the atomic level this process
is described as dissolution of various types of impurity-defect clusters.
Phenomenologically this process can be described by a transient equation with
an Arrhenius type temperature dependent time constant.
</p>
<p>
This example simulates Boron transient activation at 3 different temperatures.
The implant dose of 2e14 ions/cm**2 leads to the maximum concentration below
the solid solubility level. The 30 minute anneal results in incomplete
activation. The &quot;activation ratio&quot; is calculated using EXTRACT capability of
Deckbuild. The simulation results are in reasonable agreement with experimental
data presented in X.-Y. Liu et.al. Appl. Phys. Lett., v.77, No.13, p.2019, 2000.
