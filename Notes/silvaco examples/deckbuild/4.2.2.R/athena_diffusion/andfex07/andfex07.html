This example demonstrates the use of the
<b> FULL.CPL </b> model to simulate the emitter push effect on boron diffusion.
</p>
<p>
The emitter push effect is observed experimentally when a high
concentration phosphorus doped emitter region is diffused within a
boron doped base region.  The boron profile beneath the emitter region
is seen to diffuse more rapidly than the boron profile in the base
region.  This is the result of point defects that are coupled to the
diffusing phosphorus that are swept outward into the substrate where
they enhance the boron diffusion. Such effects were the driving force
behind the development of the fully coupled model in
<b> Athena/SSuprem 4.  </b> This model includes terms that describe the flux of point
defects based on gradients in impurity profiles.
</p>
<p>
The fully coupled model is invoked for the co-diffusion of boron and
phosphorus in this example by specifying the
<b> FULL.CPL </b> parameter
on the
<b> METHOD </b> statement.  This model is the most time consuming of the
<b> Athena/SSuprem 4 </b> diffusion models and should be used with caution.  The fully
coupled model, however, is the only model that can accurately simulate
the emitter push effect.
